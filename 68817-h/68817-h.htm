<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><i>Great numbers of thoughtful people are just
now much perplexed to know what to make of
the facts of life, and are looking about them for
some reasonable interpretation of the modern
world. They cannot abandon the work of the
world, but they are conscious that they have not
learned the art of work. They have to fight the
battle of life, but they are not sure what weapons
are fit for that battle. They are so beset by the
cares of living that they have no time for life
itself. They observe that happiness often eludes
those who most eagerly pursue it; and that the
meaning of life is often hidden from those whose
way would seem to be most free. To this state of
mind—hesitating, restless, and dissatisfied, in
the world but not content to be of the world—the
reflections of Professor Hilty, as published
in Switzerland and Germany, have already
brought much reassurance and composure; and
their message seems hardly less applicable to
English and American life. Here also the fever
of commercialism threatens the vitality of idealism,
and here also the art of life is lost in the
pace of living. Religion to a great many educated
people still seems, as Bishop Butler wrote
in 1736, “not so much as a subject of inquiry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
This seems agreed among persons of discernment”;
and a book about religion might still
begin with the words which Schleiermacher
wrote in 1806: “It may well surprise the wise
men of this age that any one should still venture
to ask their attention for a subject which they
have so wholly abandoned.” And yet, in regions
of experience which no one fails sooner or later
to enter,—regions of great joy and sorrow, experiences
of serious duty and bewildering doubts
of the meaning of life,—many a mind that has
seemed to itself to have outgrown religion looks
about for a religion that is real. Such a mind
will not be satisfied with a left-over faith; it
will not be tempted by an ecclesiastical omniscience.
It demands sanity, reserve, wisdom, and
insight, a competent witness of the things of the
Spirit. This is the state of mind to which this
little book is addressed. The author makes his appeal
not to discussion, but to life. He reports the
story of a rational experience. He walks with confidence
because he knows the way. He accepts the
saying of Pico della Mirandola: “Philosophia
veritatem quaerit, ... religio possidet.” Let us
take life, he says, just as it is and must be, and
observe that the doors which lead into its inner
meaning open only to the key of a reasonable faith.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span><i>It might be fancied that a writer thus described
must be a recluse or mystic, remote from
the spirit of the modern world and judging experiences
which he does not share. Quite the
contrary is the fact. The philosophy of life which
he teaches is wrought out of large experience,
both of academic and political affairs, and that
which draws readers to the author is his capacity
to maintain in the midst of important duties
of public service an unusual detachment of desire
and an interior quietness of mind. His short
Essays are the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,
told in the language of modern life; the Imitation
of Christ, expressed with the academic reserve
of a modern gentleman.</i></p>

<p><i>Some years ago I obtained permission from
Professor Hilty to translate for English and
American readers a few of these Essays which
had found such acceptance in Switzerland and
Germany; and the present volume, containing
his first series, has been a pleasant occupation
of some vacation days. I have found it necessary,
however, to use much freedom in dealing with
his idiomatic and epigrammatic style, and have
perhaps exceeded the legitimate right of a translator
in the attempt to reproduce the tone and
temper of the author. Nothing, I think, is here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
which Professor Hilty has not said; but there
are many shiftings of phrase and many ruptures
of German sentences; and here and there a
passage has been omitted which seemed important
to Swiss readers only. The Essay on Epictetus,
being rather a compilation and review
than an illustration of Hilty’s own philosophy
of life, is omitted; as are also the copious and
discursive footnotes which enrich the original.
I trust that these liberties and omissions may
not obscure the qualities of Professor Hilty’s
mind—its insight, sagacity, humor, and devoutness—which
no one who has had the privilege
of his personal acquaintance can recall
without affection and gratitude.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p><i>Carl Hilty was born February 28, 1833, at
Chur, Switzerland. He was a student at Göttingen,
Heidelberg, London, and Paris; and
an advocate at Chur, 1855-1874. In 1874 he
was appointed Professor of Constitutional Law
(Staats- und Völkerrecht) in the University of
Bern, which position he still holds. Since 1890
he has been a member of the Swiss House of
Representatives (Nationalrat); and in 1901
he was Rector of the University of Bern.
Among his scientific writings may be named the
following: Theorists and Idealists of Democracy
(Theoristen und Idealisten der Demokratie),
Bern, 1868; Ideas and Ideals of Swiss
Politics (Ideen und Ideale schweizerischer
Politik), Bern, 1875; Lectures on the Swiss
Political System (Vorlesungen über die Politik
der Eidgenossenschaft), Bern, 1879; On Capital
Punishment (Ueber die Wiedereinführung
der Todesstrafe), Bern, 1879; The Neutrality
of Switzerland (Die Neutralität der Schweiz
in ihrer heutigen Auffassung), Bern, 1889
(French translation by Mentha, 1889); The
Referendum in Switzerland (Das Referendum
im schweizerischen Staatsrecht), Archiv
für öffentliches Recht, 1887; The Boer War<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
(Der Burenkrieg), Bern, 1900. He has also
been the editor of the Journal of Swiss Jurisprudence
(Politisches Jahrbuch der schweizerischen
Eidgenossenschaft) since 1886.</i></p>

<p><i>In the midst of this scientific activity Professor
Hilty has expressed his inner life through
a series of little books issued at intervals during
the last ten years, as follows: Happiness
(Glück), First Series, 1891, Second Series,
1895, Third Series, 1898; On Reading and
Speaking (Lesen und Reden), 1891; For
Sleepless Nights (Für schlaflose Nächte)
[Brief Readings for each Day of the Year],
1901.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">I. THE ART OF WORK</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_t.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE most important of all
arts is the art of work; for
if one could thoroughly understand
this art, all other
knowledge and conduct
would be infinitely simplified.
Few people, however,
really know how to work, and even in an
age when oftener perhaps than ever before
we hear of “work” and “workers” one cannot
observe that the art of work makes much
positive progress. On the contrary, the general
inclination seems to be to work as little as
possible, or to work for a short time in order
to pass the remainder of one’s life in rest.</p>

<p>Work and rest—are they then aims in
life which are positively contradictory? This
must be our first inquiry; for while every
one is ready with praise of work, pleasure in
work does not always come with the praising.
So long as the disinclination to work is
so common an evil, indeed almost a disease
of modern civilization, so long as every one
as soon as possible endeavors to escape from
the work which he thus theoretically praises,
there is absolutely no hope for any bettering
of our social condition. Indeed, if work
and rest were contradictories, our social conditions
would be wholly beyond redemption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>For every human heart longs for rest. The
humblest and least intellectual know the need
of it, and in its highest moods, the soul seeks
relief from constant strain. Indeed, the imagination
has found no better name for a
future and happier existence than a state of
eternal rest. If work, then, is necessary, and
rest is the cessation of work, then the saying—“In
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread”—is indeed a bitter curse and this
earth is a “vale of tears.” In every generation
there are but few who can on such terms be
said to lead a worthy or a human life; and
even these can do so only by dooming other
human beings to the curse of work and by
holding these others fast bound in its slavery.
It was from this point of view that the ancient
authors pictured the hopeless slavery
of the many as the condition under which
the few might become free citizens of a civilized
State; and even in the nineteenth century,
a considerable part of the population of
one great nation, with Christian preachers,
Bible in hand, directing them, maintained
on the field of battle the proposition that one
race should be from generation to generation
condemned to be the slave of another. Culture,
it is said, grows only under conditions
of wealth, and wealth only through accumulation
of capital, and capital only through accumulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
of the work of those who are not
justly paid; that is to say, through injustice.</p>

<p>Such are the conceptions of society which
at once confront us as we approach our subject.
The following pages are not, however,
to be devoted to any profound consideration
either of the relative or of the absolute truth
of these conceptions. I suggest, at this point,
only the obvious truth, that if, not some people,
but all, would work and work faithfully,
the “Social Question,” as it is called, would
be forthwith solved; and I may add, that by
no other means whatever is it likely to be
solved. Faithful work, however, is not to
be brought about by compulsion. Even if
the physical means of universal compulsion
were present, no fruitful work would come
of it. It is the desire for work which must be
kindled in man; and this brings us back again
to consider the principles which may be applied
to this desire.</p>

<p>The desire for work, we must, first of all,
admit, cannot be attained by instruction; or
even—as our daily experience sadly testifies—by
mere example. It must be reached
by reflection and experience; and experience
thus reflected on will reveal to any serious
inquirer the following facts. Rest, such as is
desired, is not to be found in complete inactivity
of mind or body, or in as little activity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
as possible. On the contrary, it is to be found
only in well-adapted and well-ordered activity
of both body and mind. The whole nature
of man is created for activity, and Nature
revenges herself bitterly on him who would
rashly defy this law. Man is indeed driven
out of the paradise of absolute rest, and God
gives him the command to work, but with
the work comes the consolation that work
is essential to happiness.</p>

<p>True rest, therefore, issues from work.
Intellectual rest occurs through the perception
of fruitful progress in one’s work, and
through the solving of one’s problems. Physical
rest is found in those natural intermissions
which are given by daily sleep and
daily food, and the essential and restful pause
of Sunday. Such a condition of continuous
and wholesome activity, interrupted only
by these natural pauses, is the happiest condition
on earth, and no man should wish for
himself any other outward happiness. Indeed,
we may go a step farther and add that
it does not very much matter what the nature
of this activity may be. Genuine activity,
which is not mere sport, has the property
of becoming interesting as soon as a man
becomes seriously absorbed in it. It is not
the kind of activity which ensures happiness
to us; it is the joy of action and attainment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
The greatest unhappiness which one can experience
is to have a life to live without a
work to do, and to come to the end of life
without its fruit of accomplished work.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, wholly justifiable to speak
of the “right to work.” Indeed, it is the
most primitive of all human rights. The
unemployed are, we must admit, the most
unfortunate of people. There are, however,
quite as many of these, and perhaps more of
them, in what we call the better classes than
among what we call the working classes.
The latter are driven to work by necessity,
while the former, through their mistaken
ways of education, their prejudices, and the
imperious custom which in certain classes
forbids genuine work, find themselves almost
absolutely and by heredity condemned
to this great unhappiness. Each year we see
them turning their steps with spiritual weariness
and <i>ennui</i> to the Swiss mountains and
health-resorts, from which in vain they anticipate
refreshment. Once, the summer was
enough to give them at least a temporary
restoration from their disease of idleness.
Now, they have to add the winter also, and
soon the fair valleys which they have converted
into hospitals will be open all the year
to a restless throng, ever seeking rest and
never finding it, because it does not seek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
rest in work. “Six days shalt thou labor,”
not less and not more,—with this prescription
most of the nervous diseases of our time
would be healed, except so far as they are
an inherited curse from idle ancestors. With
this prescription most of the physicians in
sanitariums and insane asylums would lose
their practice. Life is not given to man to enjoy,
but, so far as may be, to use effectively.
One who does not recognize this has already
lost his spiritual health. Indeed, it is not
possible for him to retain even his physical
health as he might under conditions of natural
activity and reasonable ways of living.
The days of our age are threescore years and
ten, and some are so strong that they come
to fourscore years; yet though there be labor
and sorrow in these years of work, still they
have been precious: thus we read the ancient
saying. Perhaps, indeed, this was its original
meaning.</p>

<p>We do well, however, to add at once one
limitation. Not all work is of equal value,
and there is spurious work which is directed
to fictitious ends, and work which is itself
fictitious in its form. Much, for instance, of
the sewing and embroidering done by cultivated
women, much of the parading of soldiers,
much of what is called art, like the useless
drumming on the piano by persons with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
no musical sense, a considerable part of the
sportsman’s life, and, not least, the time devoted
to keeping one’s accounts,—all these
are occupations of this fictitious nature. A
sagacious and wide-awake person must look
for something more satisfying than these.
Here also is the reason why factory labor,
and, in short, all mechanical occupation in
which one does but a part of the work, gives
meagre satisfaction, and why an artisan who
completes his work, or an agricultural laborer,
is, as a rule, much more contented
than factory operatives, among whom the
social discontent of the modern world first
uttered itself. The factory workman sees
little of the outcome of his work. It is the
machine that works, and he is a part of it.
He contributes to the making of one little
wheel, but he never makes a whole clock,
which might be to him his work of art and an
achievement worthy of a man. Mechanical
work like this fails to satisfy because it offends
that natural consciousness of human worth
which the humblest human being feels. On
the other hand, the happiest workmen are
those who can absolutely lose themselves in
their work: the artist whose soul must be
wholly occupied with his subject, if he hopes
to grasp and reproduce it; the scholar who
has no eye for anything beyond his special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
task. Indeed, the same thing is to be said of
those people whom we call “one-idea-ed”
and who have created their own little world
within one narrow sphere. All these have
at least the feeling—sometimes, no doubt,
without adequate reason—that they are accomplishing
real work for the world; a true,
useful, necessary work, which is not mere
play; and many such persons, by this continuous,
strenuous, and sometimes even physically
unhealthy activity, attain great old
age, while idle and luxurious men and women
of society, who are, perhaps, the least
useful and least productive class of the modern
world, must devote much of their time
to the restoration of their health.</p>

<p>The first thing, then, for our modern
world to acquire is the conviction and experience
that well-directed work is the necessary
and universal condition of physical and
intellectual health, and for this reason is the
way to happiness. From this it necessarily follows
that the idle class is to be regarded, not
as a superior and favored class, but as that
which they are,—spiritually defective and
diseased persons who have lost the right
principle for the guidance of their lives. As
soon as this opinion becomes general and established,
then, and only then, will the better
era for the world begin. Until that time, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
world will suffer from the excessive work
of some, balancing the insufficient work of
others, and it still remains a question which
of these two types is in reality the more unfortunate.</p>

<p>Why is it then that these principles—to
which the experience of thousands of years
testifies, which any one, whether he works
or does not work, can test for himself, and
which all the religions and philosophies
preach—have not made their just impression?
Why is it, for instance, that there are
still thousands of women who defend with
much passion many passages of Bible-teaching,
and yet, with astonishing composure and
in opposition to an express command of the
Bible, take one day at the most, or perhaps
none at all, for work, and six for refined
idleness? All this proceeds in large degree
from an irrational division and arrangement
of work, which thus ill-arranged may indeed
become a positive burden.</p>

<p>And this brings me back to the title of
my Essay. Instruction in the art of work is
possible only for him who is already convinced
of my first proposition, that some
work is necessary, and who would gladly give
himself to work if it were not that, to his surprise,
some hindrance confronts him. Yet,
work, like every other art, has its ways of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
dexterity, by means of which one may greatly
lessen its laboriousness; and not only the
willingness to work, but even the capacity
to work, is so difficult to acquire that many
persons fail of it altogether.</p>

<p>The first step, then, toward the overcoming
of a difficulty is in recognizing the difficulty.
And what is the difficulty which
chiefly hinders work? It is laziness. Every
man is naturally lazy. It always costs one an
effort to rise above one’s customary condition
of physical indolence. Moral laziness is,
in short, our original sin. No one is naturally
fond of work; there are only differences of
natural and constitutional excitability. Even
the most active-minded, if they yielded to
their natural disposition, would amuse themselves
with other things rather than with
work.</p>

<p>Love of work must, therefore, proceed
from a motive which is stronger than the motive
of physical idleness. And this motive is
to be found in either of two ways. It may be
a low motive, as, for instance, a passion like
ambition or self-seeking, or, indeed, the sense
of necessity, as in the preservation of life; or
it may be a high motive, like the sense of duty
or love, either for the work itself, or for the
persons for whom the work is done. The nobler
motive has this advantage, that it is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
more permanent and is not dependent on
the mere success of work. It does not lose
its force either through the disheartening
effect of failure, or the satisfying effect of
success. Thus it happens that ambitious and
self-seeking persons are often very diligent
workers, but are seldom continuous and
evenly progressive workers. They are almost
always content with that which looks
like work, if it produce favorable conditions
for themselves, although it does nothing of
this for their neighbors. Much of our mercantile
and industrial activity—and, alas!
we must add, much of the work of scholars
and artists—has this mark of unreality.</p>

<p>If, then, one were to give to a young man
entering into life a word of preliminary counsel,
it would be this: Do your work from a
sense of duty, or for love of what you are
doing, or for love of certain definite persons:
attach yourself to some great interest of human
life—to a national movement for political
liberty; to the extension of the Christian
religion; to the elevation of the neglected
classes; to the abolition of drunkenness; to
the restoration of permanent peace among
the nations; to social reform; to ballot reform;
to prison reform;—there are plenty
of such causes inviting us to-day;—and you
will soon discover an impulse proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
from these causes to yourself; and in addition
you will have—what at first is a great
help—companionship in your work. There
should be no young person, man or woman,
to-day among civilized nations who is not actively
enlisted in some such army of progress.
The only means of elevating and strengthening
youth, and training it in perseverance,
is this: that early in life one is freed from
himself, and does not live for himself alone.
Selfishness is always enfeebling, and from it
proceeds no work that is strong.</p>

<p>I go on to remark that the most effective
instrument to overcome one’s laziness in
work is the force of habit. Why should we
use this mighty force in the service of our
physical nature and not put it to use in our
higher life as well? As a matter of fact, one
can as well accustom himself to work or to
self-control, to virtue, or truthfulness, or
generosity, as he can to laziness, or self-indulgence,
or extravagance, or exaggeration,
or stinginess. And this is to be said further—that
no virtue is securely possessed until
it has become a habit. Thus it is that as a
man trains himself to the habit of work, the
resistance of idleness constantly diminishes
until at last work becomes a necessity. When
this happens, one has become free from a
very great part of the troubles of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>There remain a few elementary rules with
which one can the more easily find his way
to this habit of work. And first among such
rules is the knowing how to begin. The
resolution to set oneself to work and to fix
one’s whole mind on the matter in hand is
really the hardest part of working. When
one has once taken his pen or his spade in
hand, and has made the first stroke, his
whole work has already grown easier. There
are people who always find something especially
hard about beginning their work, and
who are always so busy with preparations,
behind which lurks their laziness, that they
never apply themselves to their work until
they are compelled; and then the intellectual
and even the physical excitement roused
by the sense of insufficient time in which
to do one’s work injures the work itself.
Other people wait for some special inspiration,
which in reality is much more likely to
come by means of, or in the midst of, work
itself. It is at least my experience that one’s
work, while one is doing it, takes on a different
look from that which one anticipated,
and that one does not reach so many fruitful
and new ideas in his times of rest as he does
during the work itself. From all this follows
the rule, not to postpone work, or lightly to
accept the pretext of physical or intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
indisposition, but to dedicate a definite and
well-considered amount of time every day
to one’s work. Then, if the “old man,” as
St. Paul calls him, is cunning enough to see
that he must in any event do some work at a
special time and cannot wholly give himself
to rest, he may usually be trusted to resolve
to do each day that which for each day is
most necessary.</p>

<p>Again, there are a great many men, occupied
in intellectual work of a productive
kind, who waste their time and lose the happiness
of work by devoting themselves to the
arrangement of their work, or still oftener, to
the introduction of their work. As a general
rule, no artistic, or profound, or remote introduction
to one’s work is desirable. On the
contrary, it usually anticipates unsuitably
that which should come later. Even if this
be doubted, the advice is at any rate good
that one’s introduction and one’s title should
be written last. Thus composed, they commonly
cost no labor. One makes a beginning
much more easily when he starts without
any preamble, with that chapter of his work
with which he is most familiar. For the same
reason, when one reads a book, it is well to
omit at the first reading the preface and
often the first chapter. For my own part, I
never read a preface until I have finished a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
book, and I discover, almost without exception,
that when, after reading the book, I
turn back for a look at the preface, I have
lost nothing by omitting it. Of course, it
must be said that there are books of which
the preface is the best part. Of these, however,
it may also be said that they are not
worth reading at all.</p>

<p>And now I may safely take still another
step and add, that, with the exception of an
introduction to your work or its central treatment,
it is best to begin with that part which
is easiest to you. The chief thing is to begin.
One may indeed advance less directly in his
work by doing it unsystematically, but this
loss is more than made good by his gain of
time. Under this head also should be added
two other rules. One is the law: “Take no
thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of itself.” Man
is endowed with the dangerous gift of imagination,
and imagination has a much larger
realm than that of one’s capacity. Through
one’s imagination one sees his whole work
lying before him as a task to be achieved
all at once, while his capacity, on the other
hand, can conquer its task only by degrees,
and must constantly renew its strength. Do
your work, then, as a rule, for each day. The
morrow will come in its own time, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
it will come the strength for the morrow.
The second rule is this: In intellectual work
one should, indeed, deal with his material
thoroughly; but he should not expect to
exhaust his material, so that there shall be
nothing further left to say or to read. No
man’s strength is in these days sufficient for
absolute thoroughness. The best principle
is to be completely master of a relatively
small region of research; and to deal with
the larger inquiries only in their essential features.
He who tries to do too much usually
accomplishes too little.</p>

<p>A further condition of good work is this,—that
one should not persist in working
when work has lost its freshness and pleasure.
I have already said that one may begin
without pleasure, for otherwise one, as
a rule, would not begin at all. But one should
stop as soon as his work itself brings fatigue.
This does not mean that one should, for
this reason, stop all work, but only that he
should stop the special kind of work which
is fatiguing him. Change in work is almost
as refreshing as complete rest. Indeed, without
this characteristic of human nature, we
should hardly accomplish anything.</p>

<p>Again, in order to be able to do much
work, one must economize one’s force, and
the practical means to this is by wasting no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
time on useless activities. I can hardly make
plain how much pleasure and power for work
is lost by this form of wastefulness. First of
all, among such ways of wasting time should
be reckoned the excessive reading of newspapers;
and to this should be added the excessive
devotion to societies and meetings.
An immense number of people, for instance,
begin their morning, the best time they have
for work, with the newspaper, and end their
day quite as regularly in some club or meeting.
They read each morning the whole of
a paper, or perhaps of several papers, but
it would be hard, as a rule, to say what intellectual
acquisition remained the next day
from such reading. This, at least, is certain,
that after one has finished his paper, he experiences
a certain disinclination for work,
and snatches up another paper, if it happen
to be within reach. Any one, therefore, who
desires to do much work must carefully avoid
all useless occupation of his mind, and, one
may even add, of his body. He must reserve
his powers for that which it is his business
to do.</p>

<p>Finally, and for intellectual work,—with
which throughout I am specially concerned,—there
is one last and important help. It
is the habit of reviewing, and revising, one’s
material. Almost every intellectual work is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
at first grasped only in its general outlines,
and then, as one attacks it a second time,
its finer aspects reveal themselves, and the
appreciation of them becomes more complete.
One’s chief endeavor, then, should
be, as a famous writer of our day remarks,
“not to achieve the constant productiveness
which permits itself no pause, but rather to
lose oneself in that which one would create.
Hence issues the desire to reproduce one’s
ideal in visible forms. External industry, the
effort to grasp one’s material and promptly
master it,—these are, indeed, obvious conditions
of authorship, but they are of less
value than that higher and spiritual industry
which steadily works toward an unattained
end.”</p>

<p>The conception of work, thus excellently
stated, meets a final difficulty which our discussion
has already recognized. For work,
under this view, maintains continuity, in
spite of and even during one’s necessary rest.
Here is the ideal of the highest work. The
mind works continuously, when it has once
acquired the genuine industry which comes
through devotion to one’s task. In fact, it is
curious to notice how often, after pauses in
one’s work not excessively prolonged, one’s
material has unconsciously advanced. Everything
has grown spontaneously. Many difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
seem suddenly disposed of, one’s
first supply of ideas is multiplied, assumes
picturesqueness, and lends itself to expression;
so that the renewal of one’s work occurs
with ease, as though it were merely the
gathering of fruit which in the interval had
ripened without effort of our own.</p>

<p>This, then, is a second reward of work, in
addition to that which one commonly recognizes.
Only he who works knows what enjoyment
and refreshment are. Rest which
does not follow work is like eating without
appetite. The best, the pleasantest, and the
most rewarding—and also the cheapest—way
of passing the time is to be busy with
one’s work. And as matters stand in the
world to-day, it seems reasonable to anticipate
that at the end of our century some social
revolution will make those who are then
at work the ruling class; just as at the beginning
of the last century a social revolution
gave to industrious citizens their victory over
the idle nobility and the idle priests. Wherever
any social class sinks into idleness, subsisting
like those idlers of the past on incomes
created by the work of others, there
such non-productive citizens again must
yield. The ruling class of the future must
be the working class.</p>

OF LIFE</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MANY people in our day—even
well-intentioned people—have
lost their faith
in idealism. They regard it
as a respectable form of philosophy
for the education
of the young, but as a creed
of little use in later life. Theoretically, they
say, and for purposes of education, idealism
has much to commend it, but, practically,
things turn out to be brutally material. Thus
such persons divide life into two parts, in
one of which we may indulge ourselves in
fine theories and sentiments, and, indeed,
are to be encouraged in them; and in the
other of which we wake rudely from this
dream and deal with reality as best we can.
Kant, in one of his briefer writings, dealt a
hundred years ago with this state of mind.
He examined the phrase which was even
then familiar: “That may be well enough in
theory, but does not work in practice”; and
he showed that it expressed an absurd contradiction
unworthy of a thinking being.</p>

<p>The logical realism of our day, however,
is not concerned with theoretical propositions.
It turns, on the contrary, to the hard
fact of the struggle for existence, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
indifference to others and absolute self-interest
are not only permissible, but, as one
looks at the real conditions of life, seem more
or less positively demanded. These modern
realists say: “The world we see about us is
one where only a few can succeed and where
many must fail. There are not good things
enough for all. The question is not whether
such a state of things is right or just. On the
contrary, it must be admitted to be a hard,
unreasonable, unjust universe. It is not for
the individual, however, set without consent
of his own in such a universe, to change it.
His only problem is to make it certain that
in such a universe he is ‘the hammer, not
the anvil.’”</p>

<p>Such is the essence of that worldly wisdom
which is the creed of many cultivated
people to-day. With it disappears, of course,
any need of moral or religious education.
Such instruction in schools might as well
be abandoned. Indeed, Saint-Just made the
original suggestion that instead of such instruction
there should be substituted the
daily study of the placards posted on the
street corners which announce the police
regulations of the government as to the conduct
of life. Under such a theory of education,
young people would grow immensely
clever and practical. They would be trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to get and to keep. They would be free from
every sentiment of honor which might be a
hindrance in their path. Most of them, it
must be confessed, would, early in life, lose
physical, intellectual, and moral vigor, and
others would lament, perhaps too late, that
their youth had been sacrificed to that which
was not worth their seeking. At the best, they
would acquire but uncertain possessions to
be defended daily against a thousand competitors,
and these possessions would bring
bitterness along with them, both to those
who have them and to those who have them
not. Peace and happiness would be secured
to no one. Such seems to be the issue of this
view of life which is now so common among
us, and which we call the view of the “practical”
man.</p>

<p>But what is idealism? It is, as I understand
it, a form of faith, an inward conviction.
It is absolutely necessary for the permanence
of the world; yet it never can be
proved true, and indeed for him who has it
needs no proof. Further, no one becomes an
idealist by being taught about it or by reasoning
concerning it. Nor is this so strange as it
might seem, for the very trustworthiness of
the human reason itself is proved to us only
by experience. The very truths of religion remain
unproved unless the moral power which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
issues from them provides their proof. That
which has power must have reality. No other
proof of reality is final. Even our senses could
not convince us, if our experience and the
experience of all other men did not assure
us that we could—not unconditionally, but
under normal conditions—trust them not
to deceive. That which brings conviction to
one is his experience, and that which rouses
in him the desire and the inward disposition
to believe in his own experience is the testimony
of others who have had that experience
themselves.</p>

<p>There is a short treatise, written by one
who in his youth was a friend of Goethe’s,—the
Russian General von Klinger,—which
gives its testimony in a few words concerning
this idealism in practical life. It may be found
in von Klinger’s rarely opened works, under
the title: “How it is possible without deceit,
and even in constant conflict with evil, to
overcome the world.” Its contents are simply
a series of weighty aphorisms, of which
I select a few:</p>

<p>“First of all,” says von Klinger, “one who
would overcome the world must give up
thinking of what people call happiness, and
must with all his might, without indirectness,
or fear, or self-seeking, simply do his
duty. He must, that is to say, be pure in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
mind and heart, so that none of his actions
shall be stained by selfishness. Where justice
and right-dealing are called for, there
must be in him no distinction of great or
small, of significant or insignificant....</p>

<p>“Secondly, for the protection of his own
strength and his purity of conduct, he must
be free from the desire to shine, free from the
shallowness of vanity and the restless search
for fame and power. Most human follies
proceed from the restlessness of ambition.
Ambition demoralizes both those whom it
masters and those through whom it accomplishes
its ends. The boldest and most candid
criticism does not wound so deeply as
does the foolish longing for praise....</p>

<p>“Again, one who is thus pure in motive
will permit himself to be conspicuous only
when and where his duty demands it. For
the rest, he will live a life of seclusion in his
family, with few friends, among his books,
and in the world of the spirit. Thus he avoids
that conflict with others about trifles which
to many persons are of such absorbing concern.
One may be pardoned for eccentricity
in such affairs by having no place at all
among them. His life does not touch the
circle of society, and he asks of society only
to let him do his duty, and then to be permitted
to live in peace. It may be that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
will thus stir others to envy or to hate, but
it will be an envy and hate too petty for expression,
or at any rate ineffective for harm.
He who has thus withdrawn from trifles gets
much out of life. Indeed, he gets more than
he expects and more than he has intended;
for he finally gains that which men in its
coarser sense call happiness....</p>

<p>“To all this,” says von Klinger, “I add
another point: that one must withhold himself
from all ambition to pose as a reformer
and from all signs of that desire. He must
not enter into controversy about opinions
with people who have nothing but opinions.
He must speak of himself only to himself
and think of himself only in himself....
I have developed,” concludes von Klinger,
“my own character and my own inner experience
as my power and disposition have
permitted; and so far as I have done this seriously
and honestly, so far has come to me
of itself what men call happiness and prosperity.
I have observed myself more deeply
than others and dealt with myself more unsparingly
than with others. I have never
played a part, never felt inclined thereto,
and have ever expressed the convictions I
have reached without fear, and have held
them fast, so that I now no more fear the
possibility of being or doing other than my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
convictions demand. One is safe from the
temptations of others only when one can no
more tempt himself. I have borne many responsibilities,
but at the conclusion of each
I have passed the rest of my time in the
profoundest solitude and the most complete
obscurity.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The author of these weighty aphorisms
was dealing especially with political life. He
does not seek for them any philosophical
basis. He offers them simply as the result
of his stirring and often adventurous career,
and as such his testimony is far more valuable
than if it had issued from the closet of
a philosopher or a theologian who had slight
contact with practical affairs. It is not my intention
to translate these suggestions into
abstract form and make them less real and
persuasive. I only desire to annotate them
with a few practical comments.</p>

<p>I. Concerning von Klinger’s first proposition,
it is to be said that true idealism is
not the deceiving of oneself concerning reality,
or the intentional ignoring of reality,
or the hiding from reality, or the creating
for oneself a world of unreality. Idealism,
on the contrary, is reached by a deeper interpretation
of the world, by victory over it
and especially by victory over oneself. For
we, too, are an integral part of the world and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
we cannot conquer the whole unless, first
of all, we conquer our own part of it, by
strength of principles and force of habit.
Hence issues that right judgment of success
which von Klinger lays down. One of
our own contemporaries, Thiers, a man who
had in high degree attained success, and who
at certain points in his life pursued it with
excessive zeal, once made this striking remark:
“Men of principle need not succeed.
Success is necessary only to schemers.” In
other words, a genuine victory over the world
is not to be achieved through that kind of
success which the French call <i>succès</i> and
which for many men makes the end of effort.
He who plays this game of ambition may
as well abandon the hope of peace of mind
or of peace with others, and in most cases
he must forfeit outright his self-respect.</p>

<p>Real success in life, then, the attainment
of the highest human perfection and of true
and fruitful activity, necessarily and repeatedly
involves outward failure. Success, to
von Klinger, means an honorable career
with victory at its close. The work of life is
regarded in its wholeness, as a brave and
honorable man should wish and hope it to
be. Unbroken success is necessary only for
cowards. Indeed, one may go further and
say that the secret of the highest success in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
important affairs often lies in failure. The
men who have most completely commanded
the admiration of the world, and who are
most conspicuous in history, are not those
who have reached the goal of life through
success alone. Cæsar and Napoleon would
have been remembered only as examples
of tyranny if it had not been for Brutus,
Waterloo and St. Helena. The Maid of
Orléans would be recalled as a masterful
woman like many others had it not been
for her martyrdom. Hannibal would be no
noble example if Carthage had conquered.
A traitor like Charles I. of England is still
held in high honor by many persons who
cannot endure the memory of the most heroic
character in modern history,—Cromwell.
Had Cromwell died on the scaffold
and Charles on the throne, this estimate of
them would have been reversed. The life of
the Emperor Frederick III. is another example
and will be a still more impressive
one as the better future looks back on it.
The greatest example of all, the cross, the
gallows of its time, became for all the world
a sign of honor and subdued to itself the
power of Rome. Looking at Christianity
in a wholly human and untheological way,
one may believe that its unexampled success
would not have been possible if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
scholars and scribes of that day had welcomed
it. Something of such failure comes
with all right ways of life. Without it, life
sinks in the rut of commonplace. This kind
of failure should not bear the common reproach
of misfortune. It is, on the contrary,
the crown of thorns which marks the way
of the cross, and proves to be the true crown
after all.</p>

<p>II. Concerning the second aphorism of
von Klinger’s there is this to add: that no
self-seeking person ever reaches the end he
most desires. It is surprising to see what one
may accomplish when he gives his attention
and energy wholly to the doing of one thing.
Examples of this kind of success meet us at
every turn. What these persons at heart desire,
however, is not the wealth, or honor, or
power, or learning which they reach. They
prize these possessions only as the necessary
prerequisites for happiness. What is it,
then, of which they must first of all be convinced?
It is the truth that happiness does
not come through these possessions, that, in
fact, these possessions are likely to bring unhappiness.
When this conviction is attained,
then, at last, the self-seeking spirit will perhaps
abandon its aim.</p>

<p>Of all self-seekers, the most unfortunate
are to be found among the educated. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
they stand on the lower rung of the ladder
which they wish to climb, they are consumed
by envy of those above them; and of all the
emotions which degrade a man in his own
eyes the most humiliating is envy. When,
on the other hand, they have climbed to the
top, then they are distressed by the constant
fear of those who are climbing toward them
and whose thoughts and purposes they well
know from their own experience. If they seek
safety by surrounding themselves by flatterers,
then they are never safe from betrayal;
for if they seem likely to fall, no one cares
to hold them up. If, finally, they shut their
ears to these disturbing voices within their
hearts and give themselves to self-indulgence,
then they lose the very qualities which
are most essential to success.</p>

<p>Besides all this, the chances of success for
the self-seeker are slight. Not one in ten attains
what he desires, and, even of those
whom we call fortunate, few should be so
reckoned until they die. It is not necessary to
cite examples of such failure. The daily paper
reports them to us every morning. Long ago
one of the prophets of Israel described this
unsatisfying result of life and effort in classic
words which we may well repeat: “Ye have
sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye
have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is
none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth
wages to put it into a bag with holes.”</p>

<p>Still further, nothing is so exhausting as
this self-seeking effort. The passion which it
develops is like an access of fever which burns
away one’s vitality. The strength of health,
on the other hand, renews itself through self-forgetting
work; and thrives on unselfish
service done for worthy ends. Only in such
service are other people sincerely inclined
to help. Thus it happens that some people,
though they work hard and never retire to
the health-resorts, still live to a robust old
age, while other people spend half the year
or perhaps the whole of it at the baths and
remain without rest. The many nervous diseases
of our time are for the most part caused
by the self-centred life, and their real cure
must be through a renewal in health of mind
and will.</p>

<p>III. As to von Klinger’s third suggestion,
it is to be said that the inclination to solitude
is absolutely necessary not only for
happiness, but for the tranquil development
of one’s spiritual life. The happiness which
can really be attained, and which is independent
of all changes, is to be found in a life
given to great thoughts and in a work peacefully
directed toward great ends. Such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
life is, however, necessarily withdrawn from
fruitless sociability. As Goethe says, “To
such a life, all else is vanity and illusion.”
It is by such a course of life that one by degrees
escapes from the fickleness and moodiness
of life. He learns not to take people too
seriously. He comes to regard with tranquillity
the shifting changes of opinions and inclinations.
So far as his inclination goes and
his duties permit, he would rather shun popularity
than seek it.</p>

<p>IV. As to the last of von Klinger’s paragraphs,
it may be said to contain the philosophy
of his life. Looking at people as
individuals, their lives appear full of contrasts;
but taking them all together, their
lives are in fact much alike. One section of
humanity, of high and of low estate, lives
either consciously or unconsciously a merely
animal life. Such persons simply follow the
path which their physical nature indicates,
fulfilling their little span of life, and knowing
no other destiny. Another group is ever
seeking some escape from this unsatisfying
end of life. Dante, in the first canto of his
Divine Comedy, very beautifully describes
these seekers for the better life; and this
search makes in reality the spiritual experience
of all great personalities.</p>

<p>The first step in this way of life is taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
when one becomes discontented with life as
it is and longs for something better. One’s
reason seeks an outlet from the labyrinth of
the world and at last from sheer weariness
resolves, at any cost, to forsake the world’s
ways and to seek peace. When one has come
to this resolution, then he is on the way to
salvation, and experiences that inner happiness
which one gains who has found at last
the way he ought to go. And, indeed, this
man is essentially saved; for he is now open
to the unhindered influences of new spiritual
forces, against which in his early life his will
had set itself.</p>

<p>Yet, as a matter of fact, he is only ready
for his second step. It is the long conflict for
supremacy between what the Apostle calls
“the old and the new man.” Both of them
are in him still and his problem is to realize
the “new man” and bring it to fulness of life.
Many people who are striving for the better
life come to this second step and stay there
all their days; and this is the reason why so
many lives which are rightly directed still
give the impression of imperfection, and
why they do not seem to contribute much—though
often more than we think—to
the ennobling of human relationships.</p>

<p>There remains the third step of spiritual
growth, which, once fairly taken, leads to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the complete interpretation of life. It is the
stage of practical activity, the participating
in the creation of a spiritual kingdom. Sometimes
it has been likened to the taking part
in a great work of architecture, sometimes to
the enlistment in an active war. Nothing less
than this life of unselfish service can bring
to the individual true content. So long as
one lives for himself and is considering, even
in the highest and noblest way, his own self-culture,
there lingers in him some taint of
his original selfishness, or, at best, he but
half sees his way. As Goethe has expressed
it: “While one strives, he errs.” This self-directed
effort must, at last, cease. Nothing
is more untrue, nothing is more fundamentally
disheartening, than the maxim of Lessing
which so many have admired, according
to which endless effort after truth is to
be preferred to the possession of the truth.
One might as well say that endless thirst,
or endless cold, was more acceptable than
the finding of a refreshing fountain or the
warmth of the quickening sun.</p>

<p>Here then, in this attitude of life, removed
from religious or philosophical restlessness,
is the path to continuous inward peace and
power. It leads, first of all, to humility and
to freedom from self-complacency. It is possible
to hold to this path through the midst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
of all natural ills; it is the best way that life
has to offer. What the happiness is which
one then finds is hard to communicate to another.
It comes of ceasing to think first of all
of oneself. It has, as Rothe says, “no private
business to transact.” It does its work tranquilly,
with absolute certainty that, though
the issue of its work may be unrecognized,
still it is secure. This way of life brings with
it courage, and this courage manifests itself,
not in feverish excitement, but in an outward
habit of composure which testifies to
inward and central stability. Such a life trusts
its way and its destiny. Outward experiences
and the judgments of other men have no
power to move it. It is, perhaps, not essential
that in the education of youth these truths
should be urgently pressed, for they may
easily appear visionary and in such a matter
all appearance of obscurity and unreality
is to be deplored. God permits only high-minded
souls, like von Klinger, fully to attain
this way of life.</p>

<p>We need not discuss whether all this
should be called idealism—a name which
would drive many clever people from its acceptance.
Whatever it may be named, it is a
faith which has brought to those who have
confidently given themselves to it greater inward
peace than is found in any more familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
creed. It needs but slight observation of life
or of history to be convinced of this. And
yet, I fear, most of my readers may be more
inclined to say with King Agrippa: “Almost
thou persuadest me,” little as Agrippa profited
by the success he attained.</p>

<p>A German poet sums up the richness
of this spiritual peace, which men like von
Klinger exhibit, in lines which I thus slightly
adapt:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III. GOOD HABITS</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_t.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE most important experience
which, sooner or later,
meets every thoughtful person,
both in his own intellectual
development and in
his observation of others, is
this,—that every act, and,
indeed, every definite thought, leaves behind
it an inclination which is like a material influence,
and which makes the next similar
thought, or act, easier, and the next dissimilar
thought, or act, more difficult. This is the
curse of evil conduct,—that it ever brings
forth more evil conduct; and this too is the
sure and chief reward of good conduct,—that
it strengthens the tendency to good
and makes permanent what has been gained.
Here is the solemn and tragic fact which lies
behind all human life,—that what we have
once done we can never change. There it
remains, just as it happened, little as we may
be inclined to believe, or to admit, that it
is there. And hence it is that history truly
written is no entertaining drama, ending in
general reconciliation and embrace, but a
tragedy which describes the movement of
destiny.</p>

<p>If, then, one begins thus to take life seriously,
he will soon observe that its main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
problem does not concern its thought or
its faith, still less any outward confession
which may leave the soul within quite undisturbed.
The real problem of life is simply
and solely one of habit, and the end of all
education should be to train people to inclinations
toward good. To choose discreetly
between good and evil is not always practicable,
for human passions are sometimes
too strong; but what may be developed is
a prompt and spontaneous instinct for the
good; and the ideal of human life is one
in which all that is good has become sheer
habit, and all that is bad is so contrary to
nature, that it gives one even a physically
perceptible and painful shock. Failing this,
all that one calls virtue or piety is but a
series of those good intentions with which
the path to evil, as to good, may be paved.</p>

<p>What, then, are the most important of
good habits? I propose to name a few, not
in any systematic fashion; for of systems of
morals the modern world seems to have had
more than enough, and it is much more likely
to give some attention to purely practical
suggestions based on practical experience.</p>

<p>The first and chief rule seems to be this,—that
one should try rather to cultivate
good habits than merely negatively to escape
from bad ones. It is much easier in the inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
life, as in the outer, to attack positively than
to repel defensively; for in aggressive conduct
every success brings joy, while in mere
resistance much of one’s effort seems to have
no positive result. The main point to be
gained is the habit of prompt resolution,
directed immediately toward action. What
Voltaire said of the history of nations is in
large degree true of human life: “I have
noticed that destiny in every case depends
upon the act of a moment.”</p>

<p>The second principle of good habits is
fearlessness. Perhaps this is not possible to
acquire in a high degree without a strong religious
faith. This I will not discuss. It is, at
any rate, certain that fear is not only the
least agreeable of human emotions, so that
one should at any cost conquer it, but that
it is also the most superfluous. For fear does
not prevent the approach of that which is
feared; it only exhausts beforehand the
strength which one needs to meet the thing
he fears. Most of the things which we fear
to meet are not in reality so terrible as they
appear to be when looked at from afar. When
they meet us, they can be borne. The imagination
is inclined to picture evils as more
permanent and persistent than they are really
to be. If, as one’s trouble approached, he
should say to himself: “This is likely to last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
about three days,” one would in many cases
be justified by the event, and, at any rate,
would proceed to meet the trouble with a
better courage. On the whole, the best defence
against fear which philosophy can provide
is the conviction that every fear is a
symptom of some wrong condition in ourselves.
If one search for that weakness and
rid himself of it, then, for the most part, fear
will vanish also.</p>

<p>Beyond this philosophical defence from
fear, however, lie certain spiritual conditions
of courage. The chief of these is determining
for oneself what are the best blessings of life.
First of all, one must acquire as soon as possible
the habit of preferring the better things
to the worse. He must especially abandon
the expectation of possessing at the same
time different things which are contradictory
of each other. Here is the secret of failure
in many a career. In my opinion, a man
may not only freely choose his aims in life,
but he may attain all those aims which he
seriously and wholly desires, provided that
for the sake of this desire he is ready to surrender
all other desires which are inconsistent with it.
The best possessions one can
have in life, and the things which, with reasonable
sagacity, are the easiest to get, are
these: firm moral principles, intellectual discipline,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
love, loyalty, the capacity for work
and the enjoyment of it, spiritual and physical
health, and very moderate worldly possessions.
No other blessings can be compared
with these, and some other possessions are
inconsistent with these—for instance, great
wealth, great worldly honor and power, habitual
self-indulgence. These are the things
which people commonly most desire, and
which they very often attain, but they must
always be attained through the surrender of
the better things.</p>

<p>One must, therefore, promptly and unhesitatingly
determine to surrender the desire
for wealth, honor, and luxury, and to take
in their place other possessions. Without
this determination, there can be no religious
or philosophical basis of spiritual education.
What seems to be spiritual development
ends in unreality, vacillation, at last hypocrisy.
It must be confessed that even the
best of men are, as a rule, but half-hearted in
making this fundamental resolution. They
give up under compulsion one or another
fragment of their desires. Few are sagacious
enough to foresee the choice which sooner
or later must be made, and free themselves
while they are still young from their prolonged
perplexity by one quick and sublime
decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>A further obstacle to any worthy life is the
desire for praise, or for pleasure. The man
who is dominated by either of these motives
is simply a slave of the opinions or tastes of
others. Both of these desires must be, without
compromise, expelled, and sympathy,
which one has always at his command, must
take their place. For, if the lower desires
have been cast out and no higher impulses
enter, then we have simply an unendurable
emptiness in life. “When the unclean spirit,”
says the Gospel, “is gone out of a man, he
walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and
findeth none.... Then goeth he, and taketh
with himself seven other spirits more
wicked than himself, and they enter in and
dwell there: and the last state of that man
is worse than the first.”</p>

<p>Thus, at any cost, and even for the sake
of one’s own soul, one must make it his
habit to cultivate love for others, not first of
all inquiring whether they deserve that love
or not—a question which is often too hard
to answer. For without love life is without
joy, especially when one has outgrown his
youth. Lacking love, we sink into indifference,
and indifference passes easily into aversion,
and one’s aversions so poison life that
life is no better than death.</p>

<p>Further, our dislikes must be directed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
not against people, but against things. Good
and evil are too much mingled in persons
to be justly distinguished, and each unjust
judgment reacts upon those who have permitted
themselves to be unjust and embitters
their lives. Therefore, permit neither your
philosophy nor your experience to crowd out
of your life the power to love. Dismiss the
preliminary question of another’s right to be
loved. Love is the only way of keeping one’s
inner life in peace, and of maintaining an interest
in people and in things. Without it,
both people and things become by degrees
an annoyance and affront. Thus love is, at
the same time, the highest worldly wisdom.
One who loves is always, though unconsciously,
wiser than one who does not. If you
incline to say with the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>This is my creed and this will ever be,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To love and hate as others may treat me!</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>live for a while by this creed, and you will
learn soon enough how much of hate and
how little of love you are likely to receive.</p>

<p>In all the points thus far indicated, and especially
in the last, there is no place for half-way
conduct. There must be a complete and
absolute decision, with no petty and clever
computations of consequences. And in addition
to these more decisive rules of habit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
there are many smaller ones which go to reinforce
and make practicable the larger principles.
For instance, there is the Gospel command:
“Let the dead bury their dead.” The
dead are the best people to do this work. If
one refrain from controversy about what is
past and gone, then one may give himself to
tasks of positive construction, and not merely
to that destructive work which, even if it be
essential, should be subordinate. Many a memorial
has been dedicated to those who destroy
which should have been reserved for
those who fulfil.</p>

<p>And yet, one must not let himself be
cheated. He must not even be thought to
be easily duped. He must let the would-be
clever people know that he reads their
thoughts and knows what they are seeking.
One may, as I have already said, read such
thoughts quite thoroughly if one be no longer
blinded by any selfishness of his own.</p>

<p>Apart from this degree of self-defence,
which is so far necessary, the better plan in
general is to see the good side of people and
to take for granted that there is good in them.
Then it not only happens that they often
make the effort to be good and become actually
better through one’s appreciation of
them, but it also happens that one is saved
from a personal experience of regret or distress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
For intercourse with persons whom
one recognizes as bad, demoralizes one’s
own nature, and in the case of sensitive persons
may go so far as to have even a physical
effect. What is bad needs no severity of
criticism or of reproach. In most cases it
needs only to be brought to the light. Then,
even if the man protest that he is not bad,
his conscience judges him. Therefore, when
one must blame others, he should proceed
with great calmness, speak of the matter
without disguise and without glossing, but
simply and without passion. Passionate reproaches
seldom do good, and good people
who lack sympathy are apt to be very trying.
There is a kind of virtuous character not unfamiliar
in some Protestant circles which to
those who differ from its convictions seems
to have no capacity for love. It is especially
aggravating to young people, so that they
often prefer the company of the vicious to
that of moral but cold-blooded friends.</p>

<p>Finally, it may not appear possible for
you to be equally friendly with everybody.
Well, then, discriminate among people, but
always in favor of the humble, the poor, the
simple, the uneducated, the children, even
the animals and plants. Never, on the other
hand, if you desire a quiet mind, seek the
favor of important people, and never expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
gratitude for condescension to the humble,
but count the love they have for you as precious
as you do your love for them.</p>

<p>There are many other of these lesser instances
of good habits which I might still
further mention, and if my reader should
recall them, he is not to regard them as unrecognized
by me. I only invite him, in the
first place, to put to practical use my list as
thus far suggested. As he does so, let him
notice—as he soon must notice—that it is
much more to his purpose to begin practically
with one good habit than to begin by
making a complete catalogue of all. The real
difficulty in this cultivation of good habits—indeed
the only difficulty—is in ridding
the heart of its natural selfishness. For selfishness
is the practical obstacle to good habits,
though it may pretend to believe in them.
No one who understands himself will deny
that there is in every one a curious tendency
to moral degeneration. It is often something
that literally borders on depravity. Now,
this inclination to evil is to be conquered only
by a superior force; and the whole problem,
both of philosophy and of religion,—a problem
as old as the world and yet new with each
individual,—is summed up in the question:
“Where shall I find this superior force which
shall make me inclined to goodness and shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
renew that spiritual health which is essential
for the right conduct of life?”</p>

<p>To this question, there are still given
many different answers. Dante, in the famous
twenty-seventh canto of the Purgatorio, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>When underneath us was the stairway all</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Run o’er, and we were on the highest step,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And said</i>:</div>
<hr class="tb" />
<div class="verse"><i>By intellect and art I here have brought thee.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>By the guidance of reason, then, the traveller
has been led to the Holy Mountain,
where at last he hears his guide say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And yet—and here we notice a marked inconsistency
in the great mediæval poet and
philosopher—it is an angel who bears these
mortal souls across the sea and brings them
to the foot of this mountain, and another
angel repeatedly restrains them from returning
on their way, even when they have
passed the Gate of Grace; and by the diamond
threshold, beyond which none may
pass without his bidding, sits a third angel,
to whom one may approach only by a miracle
of God’s grace. In all this journey, then,
the “intellect and art” which accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the traveller play, we must confess, a very
limited rôle.</p>

<p>This great question, however, of the moral
dynamic is, for the moment, not my theme,
and its answer is, I doubt not, to be finally
reached only by the way of personal experience.
Only this is to be said, once more, that
one’s self-discipline begins with the discipline
of the will. First of all comes the definite
resolution to pursue one worthy end
of life with singleness of mind and to turn
from all that is opposed to it. Given this
decision of the will, and there follows the
capacity to act. And this search is not in vain,
when one determines to make it a universal
and an unreserved search, and to recognize
the power that is attained as the only possible
proof that the right way has been found.
Whatever brings with it no sense of supporting,
calming, ethical power is not true,
and whatever does contribute this power
must, at least, have some degree of truth in
it. In the future, any philosophy of life which
proposes to be more effective than our present
philosophy must meet this test. All else
leads astray.</p>

CHILDREN OF LIGHT</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_i.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;DO not question the truth
of this text, but I cannot
fail to observe in it the most
familiar defence of worldly
wisdom against the spirit
of idealism. The objection
to idealism which we most
commonly hear is this, that it is well enough
in theory, but that it does not work in practice;
and if it be really true that worldly wisdom
and idealism are irreconcilable, then
most people must hold to the first. They
have to live on this earth, and to deal with
life as it is; they must accept the inevitable,
even though it costs them a moment of
deep regret to abandon their idealism. This
world calls for worldly wisdom; another
world may be blessed with light—on this
stone of stumbling many a life which has
already overcome the common temptation
of selfishness is still wrecked and lost.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes us, then, in this
dangerous text is its high appreciation of what
it calls the children of this world. Indeed,
these people are never so severely handled by
Christ as are the priests and the devout Pharisees
of his time. Such sayings as: “The publicans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and the harlots go into the kingdom of
God before you,” are not uttered against the
children of this world. The children of this
world know what they want and pursue the
end they set before themselves with energy
and persistence, putting away all that stands
between them and it; and this the children
of light, at least in their earlier stages of development,
seldom do. Still further, the children
of this world are not wholly impervious
to the higher motives of life. Their hearts are
not the rock where the good seed falls in vain.
They are merely the soil which is choked by
other growth, where the seed takes root but
cannot prosper. The children of this world
may at any rate claim that it is not they who
have built the crosses and scaffolds for the
servants of the truth.</p>

<p>We must not then think of the children
of this world as absolutely bad or as unappreciative
of the excellent. On the contrary,
they are generally better than they pretend
to be, and among them are many persons
who are, as it were, hypocrites reversed; who
conceal, that is to say, their best thoughts.
What they lack is commonly the courage to
be good. They do not have a sufficiently substantial
confidence in the moral order of the
world to guide them in the struggle for existence.
And, in fact, this assurance of the moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
order does not at first sight appear to be justified.
On the contrary, one who deserts the
wisdom of the world must anticipate, first of
all, that he will be deserted by the world and
that he will not improbably pass the greater
part of his life in uncertainty whether he
has chosen the better path. Such is the testimony
of all who have practically followed
this path and have not merely heard of it or
preached about it. Thus, the children of this
world are simply the people who prefer to
travel the common and well-known road.
The unfamiliar path may appear to them in
theory very beautiful and sublime, but they
do not find it a practicable path to follow.</p>

<p>It is still more difficult to say who are the
children of light. It is true that the Gospels
sometimes mention them, but what is the
meaning of the light of which the Gospels
speak? Whence comes it, and how does it
shine into the life of men? Here we touch
at once the greatest of human problems.
Whence come we? Whither do we go? What
is our destiny? All that can be said in plain
words of the children of light is this: that
they are seeking that which is beyond reality,
and are receptive to the suggestions of
the ideal world. The children of light are
those who supremely desire something better
than to eat and drink and to-morrow die.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
This is the motive which most stirs their
hearts and wills, and out of this desire comes
to them by degrees, first, faith, and then conviction.</p>

<p>This way to the light is in a certain degree
indicated in the Gospel of Matthew:
“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall
see God”; and it is more precisely described
in the Gospel of Luke: “If thy whole body
be full of light, the whole shall be full of
light”—a passage whose exact meaning no
one has clearly determined. Beyond such
evidence as this one can hardly go; for, if
we do, the children of this world, who know
nothing of such experiences and regard them
as extravagances or worse, will at the best
turn away like Felix and the Athenians, saying:
“We will hear thee again of this matter”;
having no more inclination than Felix
to be further drawn into such disturbing and
unprofitable discussions. The dreams of the
children of light, they will say, lead to nothing
and had better be forgotten.</p>

<p>It must be sadly confessed that a great
part of religious instruction has been singularly
unfruitful. Indeed, religion cannot be
imparted by instruction. It assumes not only
a faith in that which is beyond the world of
knowledge, but also a faith in the teachers
of religion. The teachers of religion, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
can, at the best, only produce in one a
kind of mental disposition. They can free
the mind from disinclination to their view
or from positive incapacity to share it, and
they can fortify conviction by their teaching.
This limitation in religious instruction
has more than one cause. It sometimes happens
because the hearer’s way of life is inconsistent
with idealism. It is also, and quite
as often, caused by a false definition of religion—the
notion that religion is a matter
of doctrine, a kind of science which can be
taught and learned.</p>

<p>Wherein, then, it will be asked, lies the advantage
of the wisdom of the light over the
wisdom of this world? Surely, the wisdom
of the world is a more obvious possession,
and guarantees to us more of the good things
of life than the children of light can secure.
The advantage of the children of light, I
answer, is threefold. It is to be found, first,
in the assurance that they are the possessors
of truth and are made thereby inwardly and
wholly at peace. Lessing, in his well-known
words, announced that truth was not a thing
which men should desire to possess. Happiness,
he conceived, was to be found in the
search for truth, not in its possession. But
the possession of the truth brings with it the
only true happiness—a happiness which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
abundant and unspeakable, and which no
man who has in any degree obtained it would
exchange for all the other good things of
earth. For the fundamental question is not
of possessing any definite outward thing, but
of the inward happiness attained through
that possession. Even the selfish, the envious,
and the self-indulgent do not regard
that which they want to possess as their real
aim. It is only in their eyes the essential
means to the real end, and that end is their
own inward happiness. And this is precisely
where they are self-deceived. For there is this
solemn fact about the order of the world,
which reveals itself to every candid observer,—that
such people may attain all that they
earnestly desire, yet not attain with it their
own peace. Their attainment itself, their very
success, becomes their punishment. All this
may be perhaps somewhat hard to understand,
but for the moment it may be accepted
merely as a working hypothesis, and one may
later observe in life whether it is not true. It
is by using thus a working hypothesis that
even natural science most easily reaches the
truth.</p>

<p>The second advantage which the spirit
of the truth, as we may paraphrase it, has
over the wisdom of this world is this: that
when brought to the test it is in reality much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
wiser than worldly wisdom. Nothing but
the wisdom of the children of light is in harmony
with the real laws of the universe. That
is the reason why these seemingly unwise
persons still for the most part pass through
the experiences of life with less trouble and
harm than the wise of this world. The consciences
of the children of light are undisturbed,
and a troubled conscience embitters
the best joys. They pass through life
also with much less hurry, worry, and fear,
both of people and of events. None of these
distresses of life is to be escaped except
through this frame of mind. Finally, they
live more peacefully—not only in their
own hearts, but also with other people—because
they live without the passions, hatreds,
and jealousies which make life hard
to endure. Even those who do not desire
for themselves this habit of mind, and are
not indeed capable of it, as soon as they are
convinced that the children of light mean
what they seem, that their attitude is not
merely a cloak to cover the wisdom of the
world, and that they are not vain and supercilious,
grow more attached to these “Idealists”
than to people like themselves. The
affection which goes out toward such persons
is quite beyond parallel. It is the reverence,
for instance, felt toward characters like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Nicolaus von Flüe, or Francis of Assisi,
or Catherine of Siena, or in our own time
Gordon Pasha. Thousands, for example, in
all lands deeply lamented General Gordon’s
death and felt it to be a national disaster,
although they had not the least notion of
following his life. It is a form of sentiment
which the most distinguished and most successful
political ruler of our own time does
not inspire. Persons like these, just because
they have denied themselves what seem to
others the good things of life and have abandoned
the competition for them, have become
the true rulers of their people and the
heroes of humanity. Truth, happiness, freedom
from fear and care, peace with oneself
and with all men, the sincere respect and affection
of all,—one would think that these
might be recognized as beyond a doubt the
good things of life, compared with which
the accumulation of wealth, the increase of
honor, and the resources of luxury have no
weight or significance. Indeed, the blessings
of the children of light would outweigh the
rewards of worldly wisdom, even if these rewards
could be attained with certainty and
without the bitterness, anxiety, and rivalry
which inevitably accompany them.</p>

<p>Lastly, these ideal possessions have this
further advantage,—that when attained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
they are secure; and that they are within any
one’s power to attain. One need only desire
them seriously and wholly, and cease from a
hesitating dependence on the wisdom and the
successes of this world, and then, as many
witnesses will testify from their own experience,
the blessings of the children of light
are surely attained. It may not be through
one effort. Indeed, in most cases, it only
happens after one or more crises in one’s life—crises
which are in fact not unlike death
itself, and in which a man renounces all his
early hopes. In such a crisis, however, the
worst of the way of light is passed. In everything
else it is a much easier and more agreeable
way than the worldly way, and one is
sure to meet much better company.</p>

<p>Christ has compared his way of life to
the bearing of a yoke, and indeed it always
is a yoke; but compared with other ways of
life, it is a much easier and lighter yoke.
That is the testimony of all, without exception,
who have ever borne that yoke, and
not one single person has ever been found
who, at the end of such a life, whatever may
have been its outward circumstances, has
looked back upon it with regret, or has confessed
that the way of the world was better
and happier. On the other hand, how many
there have been since the days of King Solomon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
who have come to the end of a life
which, to the wisdom of this world, seemed
successful and free, and have found it only
“vanity of vanities.”</p>

<p>One would think that this single fact
of human experience would be decisive. It
fails of its effect only, as we know, because
the lower wisdom withholds one from that
higher wisdom which ventures the larger
gain for the higher stake. Yet, I will not reproach
those who follow the lower wisdom.
I simply leave it to the reader’s own reflection
to decide whether, on weighing the case
as he best can, and considering the conditions
in which human life is ordinarily placed, he
will do better to choose the lower or the
higher way. For, after all, the most foolish
people are beyond question those who follow
this pilgrimage of life for seventy or
eighty years without ever clearly deciding
whether to choose the wisdom of this world
or the wisdom of light; and to this class of
foolish persons, who, for the most part, accomplish
nothing in the world, belong, curiously
enough, a very considerable number
of what we call the cultivated people of our
day.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_i.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;HAVE no time,—that is
not only the most familiar
and convenient excuse for
not doing one’s duty; it
is also, one must confess,
the excuse which has in it
the greatest appearance of
truth. Is it a good excuse? I must at once
admit that within certain limits the excuse
is reasonable, but I shall try to show how it
is that this lack of time occurs, and how one
may, at least in some degree, find the time
he needs. Thus my sermon differs from those
of the preachers, in having, not three heads,
but only two. This I say to propitiate those
who may protest that they have no time for
reading.</p>

<p>The most immediate reason, then, for lack
of time is to be found in the character of
the present age. There is just now a prevailing
restlessness, and a continuous mood of
excitement, from which, unless one make
himself a hermit, he cannot wholly escape.
One who lives at all in these days must live
fast. If one could observe the modern world
as a bird might look down upon it, and at
the same time could distinguish the details
of its life, he would see beneath him a picture
like that of a restless and swarming ant-hill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
where even the railway trains, as they
cross and recross each other by night and
day, would be enough to bewilder his brain.
Something of this bewilderment is, in fact,
felt by almost every one who is involved in
the movement of the time. There are a great
many people who have not the least idea
why they are thus all day long in a hurry. People
whose circumstances permit complete
leisure are to be seen rushing through the
streets, or whirling away in a train, or crowding
out of the theatre, as if there were awaiting
them at home the most serious tasks.
The fact is that they simply yield to the general
movement. One might be led to fancy
that the most precious and most unusual
possession on earth was the possession of
time. We say that time is money, yet people
who have plenty of money seem to have
no time; and even the people who despise
money are constantly admonishing us, and
our over-worked children, to remember the
Apostle’s saying, and “to redeem the time.”
Thus the modern world seems pitiless in
its exhortation to work. Human beings are
driven like horses until they drop. Many
lives are ruined by the pace, but there are
always more lives ready like horses to be
driven.</p>

<p>Yet the results of this restless haste are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in the main not convincing. There have been
periods in history when people, without
the restlessness and fatigue that now prevail,
accomplished far more in many forms
of human activity than men achieve to-day.
Where are we now to find a man like Luther,
who could write his incomparable translation
of the Bible in an incredibly brief space
of time, and yet not break down at the end
of the task, or be forced to spend months or
years in recreation or vacation? Where are
the scholars whose works fill thousands of
volumes, or the artists like Michael Angelo
and Raphael, who could be at once painters,
architects, sculptors and poets? Where shall
we find a man like Titian, who at ninety
years of age could still do his work without
the necessity of retiring each year to a
summer resort or sanitarium? The fact is
that the nervous haste of our day cannot be
wholly explained by assuming that modern
men do more work, or better work, than
their predecessors. It must be possible to
live, if not without perfect rest, still without
haste, and yet accomplish something.</p>

<p>The first condition of escape from this ineffective
haste is, beyond doubt, the resolution
not to be swept away by the prevailing
current of the age, as though one had no will
of his own. On the contrary, one must oppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
this current and determine to live as a
free man, and not as a slave either of work
or of pleasure. Our present system of the
organization of labor makes this resolution
far from easy. Indeed, our whole manner
of thinking about money-making and our
painstaking provision of money for future
generations—our capitalist system, in short—increase
the difficulty. Here is the solemn
background of our present question,
with which I do not propose to deal. We may
simply notice that the problem of the use
of time is closely involved with the problem
of that radical change which civilization itself
must experience before it reaches a more
equitable division of labor and a more equitable
distribution of prosperity. So long as
there are people, and especially educated
people, who work only when they are forced
to work and for no other purpose than to
free themselves and their children as soon
as possible from the burden of work; so long
as there are people who proudly say: “Je suis
d’une famille où on n’avait pas de plume
qu’aux chapeaux,”—so long must there be
many people who have too little time simply
because a few have too much. All this, however,
is of the future. The only practical
problem for our own age is to maintain a
sort of defensive attitude toward our lack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of time, and to seek less radical ways of fortifying
ourselves. Let me enumerate some
of these ways.</p>

<p>The best way of all to have time is to
have the habit of regular work, not to work
by fits and starts, but in definite hours of
the day,—though not of the night,—and to
work six days in the week, not five and not
seven. To turn night into day or Sunday into
a work-day is the best way to have neither
time nor capacity for work. Even a vacation
fails of its purpose, if it be given to no occupation
whatever. I am not without hope
that the time may come when medical science
will positively demonstrate that regular
work, especially as one grows older, is the
best preservative both of physical and intellectual
health. I may even add for the sake
of women among my readers, that here is the
best preservative of beauty also. Idleness
is infinitely more wearisome than work, and
induces also much more nervousness; for it
weakens that power of resistance which is
the foundation of health.</p>

<p>Work, it is true, may be excessive, but
this is most obviously the case when one
cares more for the result of his work than
he does for the work itself. Under such conditions,
it is peculiarly difficult to exercise
moderation, and as an ancient preacher remarks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
with a sigh: “Work is given to every
man according to his power, but his heart
cannot abide by it.” In such cases, however,
Nature herself has given us a monitor in that
physical fatigue which work itself produces.
One need only take account of such fatigue,
and not cheat it by stimulants, and then, even
without much philosophizing, he will not
lack self-control.</p>

<p>The habit of regular work is further
greatly encouraged by having a definite vocation
which involves positive tasks and
obligations. Thus the socialistic romances
which draw a picture of the future of the
world are quite justified when they describe
the universal organization of industry under
the form of an army, for an army represents
that way of life in which order and duty
in one’s work are most emphasized. Every
Swiss citizen knows that, with the exception
of occasional excessive demands, he has never
been in better health than when serving his
term in the army. Every hour in the day then
had its regular and sufficient task, and no one
was called to consider whether he desired to
do things or not to do them, while no one
had time to anticipate the tasks of the following
day. Here is the misfortune of many rich
people in our day,—that they have no definite
vocation. As the common saying has it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
“There is no ‘must’ for them.” For many
such persons, a specific business would be
a redemption from the dilettantism which
now threatens their peace of mind. They
might well follow the example of that Bavarian
prince who has undertaken the profession
of an oculist. I am even inclined to
believe that part of the movement toward
the higher education which is so conspicuous
among women in our day is simply the
response to this demand of human nature
for some definite vocation.</p>

<p>Another question much discussed in our
time concerns the division of one’s working
day. In great cities with their vast distances,
in the case of unmarried persons engaged in
more or less mechanical tasks, and in the
case of all people who regard their work as
a burden to be thrown off as soon as possible,
there is some advantage in working continuously
and without interruption. This is
what we are in the habit of calling the English
method. It is never possible, however, to
accomplish in this way so much intellectual
work of a productive character as may be
done under the Swiss custom of a pause at
midday. No one can continuously, or even
with momentary pauses, devote himself for
six or eight hours to work of an intellectual
character. Even if he allow himself an hour’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
interval, the sense of strain remains, together
with an abbreviation of time for work in the
afternoon. On the other hand, under the
Swiss custom, it is perfectly easy to work
for ten or eleven hours a day,—four in the
morning, four in the afternoon, and two or
three in the evening, and few of us could accomplish
our work in that eight-hour day of
which we hear so much, although we have
not the honor of being reckoned as of the
class known as “working-people.”</p>

<p>The next essential point is not to have
too much fussiness about one’s work, or, in
other words, not to permit oneself elaborate
preparations as to time, place, surroundings,
inclination, or mood. The inclination
to work comes of itself when one has begun
his work, and it is even true that a kind of
fatigue with which one often begins—unless,
indeed, it has some positive or physical
cause—disappears as one seriously attacks
his work, and does not simply, as it were, defend
himself from it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Begin with cheerfulness thy task</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Nor ask how it may end,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Farther than all that thou couldst ask</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Its issues surely tend.</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>In short, if one permit himself habitually
to stop and ask that indolent part of him
which the Apostle Paul calls “the old man”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
what he would like to do, or would prefer
not to do, “the old man” is most unlikely
to vote for serious work, but betakes himself
to excellent religious or moral advice. The
bad part of one must be forced to the habit
of obeying, without grumbling, the “categorical
imperative” of the better part. When
one has achieved this amount of soldierly
discipline in himself, then he is on the right
path, and until he has reached this point, he
has not found his way. Here he first learns
whether his life is saved or lost. Sometimes
a man proposes to himself to collect his
thoughts before he begins, or to meditate on
the work he is going to do. In most cases,
this is merely an excuse for doing nothing,
and it is most obviously such an excuse,
when, to encourage this preliminary reflection,
a man lights his cigar. In short, one’s
best ideas come while he is working, and
often, indeed, while he is working on a
wholly different topic. A distinguished modern
preacher has remarked with originality,
though not with strict accuracy, that there is
not a single case mentioned in the Bible in
which an angel appeared to a man who was
not at work.</p>

<p>In close connection with this point should
be mentioned the habit of using fragments
of time. Many people have no time because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
they always want to have a large amount of
uninterrupted time before they set themselves
to work. In such a plan they are
doubly deceived. On the one hand, in many
circumstances of life these prolonged periods
are difficult to secure, and, on the other hand,
the power of work which one possesses is not
so unlimited that it can continuously utilize
long stretches of time. This is peculiarly true
of such intellectual work as is devoted to productive
effort. Of such work it may be said
without exaggeration that the first hour, or
even the first half-hour, is the most fruitful.
Dismissing, however, these large intellectual
undertakings, there are to be found in connection
with every piece of work a great number
of subordinate tasks of preparation or
arrangement which are of a mechanical nature,
and for each of which a quarter of an
hour or so is sufficient. These minor matters,
if not disposed of in small fragments of time
which would otherwise be wasted, will absorb
the time and power which should be
devoted to one’s important task. It might,
indeed, be reasonably maintained that the
use of these fragments of time, together with
the complete dismissal of the thought, “It
is not worth while to begin to-day,” accounts
for half of the intellectual results which one
attains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Another important means for saving time
is the habit of changing the kind of work in
which one is engaged. Change is almost as
restful as complete rest, and if one acquire
a certain degree of skill in his ways of change,—a
skill which comes from experience rather
than from theorizing,—one may carry on his
work for almost the entire day. Moreover,
so far as my experience goes, it is a mistake
to plan that one piece of work shall be finished
before another is begun. The judicious
course, on the contrary, is that which prevails
among artists, who are often engaged on a
whole series of sketches, and turn, according
to the momentary inclination which overmasters
them, first to one piece of work and
then to another. Here, too, it may be remarked
is an excellent way of maintaining
one’s self-control. The old Adam in us often
persuades the better nature that he is not
really lazy, but is simply not in the mood
for a certain piece of work. In this state of
things, one should forthwith say to himself:
“Well, if you do not feel inclined to this
piece of work, take up with another.” Then
one will discover whether the difficulty is a
disinclination to a special form of work, to
which one might yield, or a disinclination
to do any work at all. In short, one must
not permit oneself to deceive oneself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Another point to be considered is the habit
of working quickly, not giving too much care
to outward form, but devoting one’s efforts
to the content of the task. The experience
of most workers will bear me out when I say
that the most profitable and effective tasks
are those which have been done quickly. I
am well aware that Horace advises one to
take nine years for the perfecting of verses;
but such scrupulousness presupposes an excessive
notion of the quality of one’s work.
Thoroughness is a very beautiful and necessary
trait, in so far as it concerns truth, for
truth cannot be too thoroughly explored;
but there is a spurious thoroughness which
absorbs itself in all manner of details and
subordinate questions which are not worth
investigating, or which cannot be wholly
known. Thoroughness of this kind is never
satisfied with itself. It is sometimes mistaken
for great learning; for to many people learning
is profound only when wholly detached
from practical usefulness, or when an author,
for a whole lifetime, has brooded over one
book.</p>

<p>Truth, wherever it may be sought, is, as
a rule, so simple that it often does not
look learned enough. People feel as if they
must add to it something which is not essential
to the nature of truth, in order to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
to truth a respectable and academic look.
Among learned people, it is often the case
that one must first earn his reputation by
some piece of work which is of no use to
himself or to any one else, and in which
he heaps together the hitherto undiscovered
rubbish of some remote century. Lassalle
was able to write his famous work on Herakleitos
without forfeiting his interest in the
affairs of modern life, but there are few authors
with this capacity for practical concerns.
On the contrary, many authors in
their maiden venture of learned work not
only have their eyesight ruined by their researches,
but lose their inward vision, which
is a matter of much more consequence. They
reach the goal of their ambition and become
of no further use.</p>

<p>A further way of saving a deal of time
is to do one’s work and be done with it;
not to deal with it, that is to say, in a provisional
or preparatory manner. This kind of
immediate thoroughness is in our day extremely
rare, and in my opinion much of
the blame should be laid to the newspapers,
which accustom people to superficial surveys
of truth. The editorial writer says, at
the close of his article, “We shall return
to this subject later”; but in fact he never
returns. So it is with the modern reader. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
he wants to make use of what he has read, he
has to begin the reading of it afresh. His
skimming of the subject—as the phrase is—has
had no result, and so the time that
he has given to skimming has been lost.
This is the reason why people have so little
thorough knowledge in our day, and why,
though they have studied a subject ten times,
on the eleventh occasion when they need it,
they must study it again. Indeed, there are
people who would be extremely glad if they
could remember even the works of which
they themselves were the authors.</p>

<p>With this point is obviously connected
the need of orderliness and of the reading
of original authorities. The habit of orderliness
saves one from the need of hunting
for material, and this search for material is
not only, as we all know, a great waste of
time, but tempts us also to lose pleasure in
our work. Further, orderliness permits us to
allow one subject to be forgotten, while we
apply ourselves to the next. The reading of
original sources, on the other hand, gives
one the advantage of being sure of his material,
and of having his own judgment about
it. There is this further advantage, that the
original sources are in most cases not only
much briefer, but much more interesting and
much easier to remember than the books that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
have been written about them. Second-hand
knowledge never gives the courage and self-confidence
which one gets from acquaintance
with original sources. One of the great mistakes
of modern scholarship, as distinguished
from that of the classic world, is—as Winkelmann
has pointed out—that our learning
in so many cases consists in knowing only
what other people have known.</p>

<p>But, after all, we have not yet named the
chief element in the art of having time. It
consists in banishing from one’s life all superfluities.
Much which modern civilization
regards as essential, is, in reality, superfluous,
and while I shall indicate several things which
appear to me unnecessary, I shall be quite
content to have my reader supplement them
by his own impressions. For instance, one
superfluity is beer. It is superfluous at any
time of the day and especially when drunk
in the morning, after the fashion made popular
by Prince Bismarck. Perhaps the greatest
contributors to waste of time in this century
are the brewers, and the time will come when
people may regard the excessive drinking of
beer as they now regard the excessive use of
alcohol in other forms.</p>

<p>I may name as a second superfluity the excessive
reading of newspapers. There are in
our day people who regard themselves as educated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and who yet read nothing but newspapers.
Their houses are built and furnished
in all possible—and impossible—styles, and
yet you will find in them hardly a dozen good
books. They get their whole supply of ideas
out of the newspapers and magazines, and
these publications are more and more designed
to meet the needs of such people.
This excessive, or even exclusive, reading of
newspapers is often excused on account of
our political interests; but one has only to
notice what it is in the newspapers which
people are most anxious to read to arrive at
a judgment whether this excuse is sound. I
may add that the time of day dedicated to
the newspaper is by no means unimportant.
People, for instance, who devote their first
hour in the morning to the reading of one
or two newspapers lose thereby the freshest
interest in their day’s work.</p>

<p>Another superfluity is the excessive going
to meetings. A man who is much devoted
to such gatherings can scarcely find time for
serious work. Indeed, it is not necessary for
him to do independent work; for he has substituted
for his own judgment the judgment
of the crowd, and the crowd carries him on
its shoulders. A great waste of time occurs,
further, among one class of people at the
present time, through a pretended devotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
to art. I do not refer to art practised by
oneself, but to art as passively accepted; and
I should perhaps make exception in what I
say, of the art of music. In other forms of art
many persons permit those impulses which
should have stirred them to idealism, and
to responsiveness toward the beautiful, to
evaporate in æsthetic satisfactions. Many
women, to speak frankly, are educated to acquire
mere artistic appreciation; and they
cannot, without severe struggles and against
great hindrances, find the way back from this
mood to any profitable and spiritually satisfying
work.</p>

<p>Another superfluity is the devotion to
social duties and the whole purposeless system
of making “calls.” These habits are the
mere shadows of genuine friendship, and of
the intellectual stimulus through personal
intercourse which they were originally intended
to express. I need not speak of superfluous
amusements. The theatre, for instance,
to accomplish its legitimate aim needs
so fundamental a reform that there would be
really nothing left of its present methods.
Finally, and of quite another category among
the elements of culture in our time, I may
name as superfluous the superficial and popular
products of materialism, and with these
the debasing French novels and dramas of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the day. People of the educated class in our
time, and especially people of the academic
circle, ought to have the courage to say of
such literature: “We know nothing about
it.” Then perhaps one might have time to
read something each day which was serious
and educative; something that tended to
strengthen the mind and to bring one into
real contact with the intellectual movement
of the age.</p>

<p>And now, lest there should be complaint
of time wasted on such reading as this, I
shall add but two other points. One of these,
stated by Rothe, is the advice that it is most
desirable not to take up one’s time with
the details of one’s business affairs. Even if
this is not altogether possible, one may, if
he wish it, greatly reduce the care of details
of administration, and live in a world of
larger and happier thoughts. The other
point, which has even more practical significance,
is this: Limit yourself to that which
you really know and which has been especially
committed to your care. For your special
task you will almost always have time
enough. An Old Testament saying states
it even more plainly: “He that tilleth his
land shall have plenty of bread: but he that
followeth after vain persons shall have poverty
enough.” As to the things which do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
concern one’s special calling, but which have
a certain significance in the world and a certain
importance for culture, it may be necessary
for one, once in his life, to acquire a
superficial survey of them by a glance at the
best original sources. One should thereafter
leave these matters alone and not concern
himself with them further.</p>

<p>Finally, in this enumeration of the things
which waste one’s time, I may add that
one must not permit himself to be overburdened
with superfluous tasks. There are
in our day an infinite number of these,—correspondence,
committees, reports, and
not the least, lectures. All of them take time,
and it is extremely probable that nothing
will come of them. When the Apostle Paul
was addressing the Athenians, he remarked
that they did nothing else than to hear some
new thing. It was not the serious part of his
address, or its spiritual quickening, to which
they gave their attention, it was its novelty;
and the outcome of his sermon was simply
that some mocked, and the most friendly
said with patronizing kindness: “We will
hear thee again of this matter.” Indeed, the
reporter of the incident finds it necessary
to mention expressly, that one member of
the Athenian City-Council and one woman
in the audience received some lasting good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
from the Apostle’s address. How is it, let
me ask you, with yourselves? Have the lectures
which you have heard been to you in
any way positive influences of insight and
decision, or have they been merely the evidences
of the speaker’s erudition?</p>

<p>Such are the ways which in our present
social conditions are open to any one to use
for saving time. I must add, however, that
if one tries to use these ways of saving time,
he will make another discovery. For one of
the most essential elements of such happiness
as we can reach on earth lies in not
having too much time. The vastly greater
proportion of human happiness consists in
continuous and progressive work, with the
blessing which is given to work and which
in the end makes work itself a pleasure. The
spirit of man is never more cheerful than
when it has discovered its proper work.
Make this discovery, first of all, if you wish
to be happy. Most of the wrecks of human
life are caused by having either no work, or
too little work, or uncongenial work; and
the human heart, which is so easily agitated,
never beats more peacefully than in the natural
activity of vigorous, yet satisfying, work.
Only one must guard against making of
work an idol, instead of serving God through
one’s work. Those who forget this last distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
find themselves in later life doomed
to intellectual or physical prostration.</p>

<p>There are, then, but two possessions which
may be attained by persons of every condition,
which never desert one through life,
and are a constant consolation in misfortune.
These are work and love. Those who shut
these blessings out of life commit a greater
sin than suicide. They do not even know
what it is that they throw away. Rest without
work is a thing which in this life one
cannot endure. The best blessing which can
be promised is that last blessing of Moses
for Asher: “Thy shoes shall be iron and
brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength
be.” Better than this one should not desire,
and if one has this he should be thankful.
Yet, it must be added, this contentedness in
continuous work is possible only when one
abandons ambition; for ambition is always
most deeply anxious not to do work, but as
soon as possible to get the result of work,
even if that result is illusive. Ambition is the
Moloch of our time, to whom we feel bound
to sacrifice even our own children, and who,
more than all other foes, destroys the bodies
and the souls of youth.</p>

<p>If, still further, one commit himself, as is
so often the case, to that philosophy of materialism
in which this brief life is the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
opportunity, so that but a few years are ours
for the accomplishment of all which the pitiless
and endless struggle for existence and
the survival of the fittest permit, then there
is an end of all restfulness and blessedness in
work. Under such a view, time is indeed too
short, and every art is indeed too long. The
true spirit of work, which has no time for
superfluities, but time enough for what is
right and true, grows best in the soil of that
philosophy which sees one’s work extending
into the infinite world, and one’s life on earth
as but one part of life itself. Then one gets
strength to do his highest tasks, and patience
among the grave difficulties and hindrances
which confront him both within himself and
in the times in which he lives. One is calmly
indifferent to much which in the sight of this
world alone may seem important, but which,
seen in the light of eternity, loses significance.
This is the meaning of that beautiful
saying of the philosopher of Görlitz, which
brings to our troubled time its message of
comfort:</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_w.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHATEVER the philosophers
may say, it remains
true that, from the first hour
of man’s waking consciousness
until that consciousness
ceases, his most ardent desire
is to be happy, and that
the moment of his profoundest regret is
when he becomes convinced that on this
earth perfect happiness cannot be found.
Here is the problem which gives to the various
ages of human history their special
characters. Blithe are those ages when young
and progressive nations still hope for happiness,
or when men believe that in some
new formula of philosophy, or of religion, or
perhaps in some new industrial programme,
the secret of human happiness has at last
been found. Gloomy are those ages in which,
as in our time, great masses of people are
burdened with the conviction that all these
familiar formulas have been illusions, and
when persons of the keenest insight say—as
they are now saying—that the very word
happiness has in it a note of melancholy. No
sooner, we are told, does one speak of happiness
than it flees from him. In its very nature
it lies beyond the sphere of practical
realization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>I do not share this opinion. I believe that
happiness can be found. If I thought otherwise,
I should be silent and not make unhappiness
the more bitter by discussing it.
It is, indeed, true that those who talk of
happiness utter therewith a sigh, as if there
were doubt whether happiness could be attained.
It is still further true that irrational
views of happiness seem to be for the present
forced upon us. Only through these imperfect
views can individuals or communities
approach that degree of spiritual and material
development which is the necessary foundation
for real happiness.</p>

<p>And here our question seems to involve
a serious contradiction. For we have, first of
all, to learn from our own experience much
that does not bring us happiness. Each in his
own way must pass, with the greatest of all
poets, through the “forest dark” to the
“city dolent,” and climb the steep path of
the “Holy Mountain,” before he may learn
how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>That apple sweet, which through so many branches</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>All this is to be attained, not through instruction,
but through experience. It is a
path, and especially the latter part of it, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
each must walk alone. No visible help is on
any side, and as one meets each of those obstacles
which in his own strength perhaps
he could not overcome, he is upborne by
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“... <i>eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>And snatched me upward even to the fire.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus the suggestions which now follow concern
themselves merely with the many misleading
ways which purport to lead toward
happiness, and in which each new generation
in its restless longing is tempted to go
astray.</p>

<p>The paths by which people journey toward
happiness lie in part through the world
about them and in part through the experience
of their souls. On the one hand, there
is the happiness which comes from wealth,
honor, the enjoyment of life, from health,
culture, science, or art; and, on the other
hand, there is the happiness which is to be
found in a good conscience, in virtue, work,
philanthropy, religion, devotion to great
ideas and great deeds.</p>

<p>The outward ways to happiness are, however,
all, in one respect, disappointing. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
are not paths which are possible for every
one to follow, and therefore, for many cannot
lead to happiness. Still further, the possession
of good things which others do not
possess cannot but bring with it to any noble
soul some twinge of conscience. One who
enjoys these outward blessings, and recalls
the millions of human beings by his side
who are perishing for lack of them, must be
either thoroughly selfish or profoundly unhappy.
It is of such persons that Jesus is
thinking when he speaks of the “unrighteous
Mammon,” and even goes on to say:
“How hardly shall they that have riches enter
into the kingdom.” No man, that is to
say, can attain to Christian happiness who
attains distinction at the cost of others. “One
that is proud in heart,” says the Book of
Proverbs, “is an abomination to the Lord.”</p>

<p>Thus it was that Francis of Assisi, and
many a saint before and after him, resolved,
at any price, to break the chains of worldly
possessions. It was a logical resolution.
Wealth is the gravest of obstacles to the
spiritual life, and few men are wholly free
from its solicitations or slavery. The possession
and administration of a large property,
and, indeed, every position of exceptional
honor and power, induce with almost absolute
certainty a hardening of the disposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
which is the very opposite of happiness. One
shudders as he observes how dull life seems
to that spiritless throng which in ever-increasing
numbers visits each year the Swiss
mountains to escape the emptiness of their
prosperous lives.</p>

<p>Such is the result of these external ways
of seeking happiness. But we do not fare
much better when we turn to that form of
happiness which lays claim to a nobler and
a spiritual source,—the happiness of the
æsthetic life. For the boundaries between
this form of happiness and that of mere materialism
are by no means easy to define.
Æsthetic enjoyment often passes over into
mere sensualism, as Goethe, the great model
of æsthetic interest, has proved to us both in
his poetry—as in the case of Faust—and
in his own life. Indeed, the new school of
æstheticism runs grave risk of interpreting
much in terms of art which is in fact mere
materialism. Those who thus seek happiness
should recall the saying of their illustrious
predecessor, who possessed in an extraordinary
degree the capacity to attain whatever
happiness in life æstheticism had to offer.
“When all is said,” remarks Goethe, “my
life has been nothing but care and work. I
can even say that in my seventy-five years, I
have not had four weeks of real happiness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
It has been a continuous rolling up hill of
a stone which must ever be pushed again
from the bottom.” Four weeks of happiness
in seventy-five years! This man of art declares
that in his view life is nothing else
than misery! There is hardly an honest day-laborer
who at the end of his life, full as it
may have been of genuine troubles, could
give so poor an account of himself.</p>

<p>The fact is, then, that human nature
seems obviously not intended for this kind
of happiness. Life is made for activity; and
this kind of receptive enjoyment, even in its
highest forms, is designed merely to give
flavor and change to life, and to be sparingly
used; so that those who give themselves too
confidently to such enjoyment bitterly deceive
themselves. Genuine happiness cannot
be arbitrarily produced. It issues from obedience
to a genuine demand of human nature,
and from intelligent activity naturally employed.
Here is the rational basis of that faith
in human equality and that contentment with
the simple joys of life, in which people to-day
believe much too little, and which awhile
ago people praised with perhaps exaggerated
sentiment.</p>

<p>Still further, as regards such æsthetic enjoyment,
it is to be observed that the level
of æsthetic judgments in literature and art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
is now so visibly sinking that these resources
cannot long satisfy minds that can be called
educated, or nations that can be called progressive.
The time may soon come when
people will weary of this “efflorescence” of
science, literature, and art; and may even wish
to exchange it for a taste of healthy barbarism.
The Austrian poet Rosegger has thus
described a not impossible future: “We already
see each year a great migration of people
passing from the cities to the country and
the mountains, and not until the leaves are
touched with autumn color returning to the
city walls. The time will come, however, when
prosperous city-folk will betake themselves
permanently to country life; and when the
work-people of the city will migrate to the
wilderness and subdue it. They will abandon
the search for book-knowledge, they will find
their pleasure and renewal in physical work,
they will make laws under which an independent
and self-respecting livelihood will
be ensured to country-dwellers; and the notion
of an ignorant peasantry will disappear.”
However this may be, it is at least certain
that we are approaching a period marked by
a return to nature, and by a taste for simplicity,
such as existed at the end of the last century,
when Marie Antoinette played shepherdess
with her courtiers at the Trianon. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
is a simplicity which is caricatured by the luxurious
folk who parade each summer through
Switzerland in mountain dresses and spiked
shoes, and attempt an intimacy with the life
of nature. Even these folk, strange as is their
attire and laughable as is their mimicry of the
life of peasants and mountaineers, find themselves
as happy as their conventional lives
permit.</p>

<p>One other external notion of happiness
may be dealt with in a word. It is the happiness
which is sought in freedom from care.
Such happiness is an ideal for those only
who have never had the experience of such
freedom. For the fact is that through our
cares, when not excessive, and through our
victory over cares, comes the most essential
part of human happiness. Cares of a reasonable
nature do not constitute what we call
care. Many a life of the widest experience
would testify that the most unendurable
experience is to be found, not in a series of
stormy days, but in a series of cloudless ones.</p>

<p>I pass, then, from those who seek for happiness
in material and outward conditions
to those more rational inquirers who seek it
in the spiritual life. These persons expect
that happiness will be secured in the doing
of their duty, in a good conscience, in personal
work of public good, in patriotism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
or charity, or some form of philanthropy, or
perhaps in conformity to the teachings of
their Church. And yet, a very considerable
part of the drift to pessimism which one observes
in our day comes of the experience
that no one of these ways leads surely to happiness,
or, at least, that one does not get in
such ways the happiness for which he hoped.
Indeed, it is perhaps still further true that
a great part of the reckless “Realism,” now
so prevalent among us, comes not of the
conviction that it will make one happy, but
only of the despair of finding any other way
of happiness. For if it be true that neither
our work, nor what we call our virtues, can
bring peace to the soul; if outward activity,
and charity, and patriotism, are but a
mockery of happiness; if religion is for the
most part only a form or a phrase, without
objective certainty; if all is thus but vanity
of vanities, then indeed: “Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die.”</p>

<p>I do not join in the condemnation with
which the moralists usually meet this view
of life. I deny only the conclusions which
are drawn from such a view. I recognize the
honest purpose of these modern philosophers.
They represent, at least, a sincere
love of truth; they are hostile to all mere
phrases. The spirit of the modern world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
looks for a happiness which is not mere
philosophical composure, but which has objective
results. It demands a kind of contentment
in which every human being may
have a share. In all this, the spirit of the age
is wholly right, and this demand for objective
happiness which it utters is a note which
has not been heard for two thousand years.
I, too, desire happiness; but I know that one
who would find the way to happiness must,
first of all, and without hesitation, throw
overboard all the false idols which have
tempted him to worship them. As he dismisses
the prejudices which birth, or circumstances,
or habits, have created, he takes one
step after another toward true happiness.
As the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, one
of the least fortunate persons of our day,
rightly said: “The abandoning of an untruth,
or of a prejudice, brings with it forthwith
a sensation of joy.” Here, then, is our
guide along this darkened road, which without
some such guidance we could not find
at all.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>The happy life lies straight before our eyes,—</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>We see it, but we know not how to prize.</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>First of all, then, we must admit that happiness
does not consist in the sense of virtue
alone. This idol of the incorruptible Robespierre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
will not serve us. For virtue in its completeness
dwells in no human heart. One
must have but a meagre conception of virtue,
or else a very limited intellectual capacity,
who finds himself always self-contented.
Even the vainest of men are not in reality
contented; their vanity itself is in large degree
only a sense of uncertainty about their
worth, so that they need the constant endorsement
of others to satisfy them. The
maxim says that a good conscience makes a
soft pillow, and he who has this unfailing
sense of duty done no doubt has happiness;
but I have not, as yet, fallen in with such a
man. My impression is that there is not one
of us who has ever, even for a single day,
done his whole duty. Beyond this, I need
not go. If one of my readers says to me: “I
am the man who has thus done his duty,”—well,
he may be quite right, but I do not
care for that man’s nearer acquaintance. The
farther a man advances in the doing of his
duty, so much the more his conscience and
perception grow refined. The circle of his
duties widens continually before him, so
that he understands the Apostle Paul, when,
with perfect sincerity, and without false humility,
he speaks of himself as the “chief of
sinners.”</p>

<p>Are, then, I ask again, philanthropy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the good deeds—public and private—which
it suggests, the secret of happiness? Love is
a great word, and the Apostle is altogether
justified when in the familiar passage of his
letters he says that among the many things
which perish, love abides. But when in the
same passage he says that it is possible to
speak with the tongues of angels, and give
all one’s goods to feed the poor, and even
give one’s body to be burned, and yet not
have love,—then we comprehend without
further explanation what he means by love.
For love is a part of God’s own being, which
does not originate in the hearts of men. One
who possesses it knows well enough that it
is not his own. Even the pale human reflection
of this Divine love brings happiness,
but it is a temporary happiness; and always
with the perilous uncertainty of a love which
anticipates return, so that the happiness depends
upon the will of others. He, then,
who yields his heart absolutely to others,
and stakes his happiness on their affection,
may some day find the terrible words of the
Jewish prophet true: “Cursed be the man
that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his
arm, and whose heart departeth from the
Lord.” All this may be one day a spiritual
experience, which may convert his love into
hate. That apotheosis of hate which marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
the talk of many a social agitator in our day
is but the evidence of those bitter disillusions
of affection which millions have been
called to feel.</p>

<p>Is, then, happiness to be found in work?
Work is certainly one great factor of human
happiness—indeed, in one sense, the greatest;
for without work all happiness which is
not mere intoxication is absolutely denied.
In order to get the capacity for happiness,
one must obey the commands: “Six days
shalt thou labor,” and “In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread.” Of all seekers for
happiness, the most foolish are those who
evade these two conditions. Without work
no man can be happy. In this negative statement
the saying is absolutely true. And yet,
it is a greater error to suppose that work is
in itself happiness, or to believe that every
work leads to happiness. It is not alone our
imagination that pictures another ideal, so
that one can hardly imagine a heaven, or an
earthly paradise, as devoted to unremitting
work; it is also true—and it is much more
to be remembered—that only a fool can
be wholly contented with the work that he
does. One might even say that the wisest
see most clearly the incompleteness of their
work, so that not one of them has been able,
at the end of his day’s work, to say of it:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
“Behold, it is very good.” This mere praise
of work, then, is, for the most part, only a
sort of a spur, or whip, with which one urges
himself, or others, to the tasks of life; so
that even those who take pride in describing
themselves as “working-people” are much
concerned to reduce as far as possible their
working day. If work were essentially the
same as happiness, these people would be
seeking to prolong as much as possible the
hours of work.</p>

<p>Of all seekers for happiness, however, the
most extraordinary are those who look for it
in the philosophy of pessimism; yet of these
there are not a few, and by no means of the
baser sort. There is, however, almost always
associated with the creed of pessimism a certain
false impression of one’s own importance.
It has an appearance of magnanimity
to throw overboard all one’s hopes, and to
believe that everything, oneself included,
is bad. For this, at least, is true, that if all are
bad, he who sees that it is so, and admits it,
is, after all, the least bad; and if he is sincerely
contented that others should regard
him as bad, he may be not far from the way
to something better. Yet, pessimism as a permanent
habit of mind is, for the most part,
only a mantle of philosophy through which,
when it is thrown back, there looks out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
face of vanity;—a vanity which is never
satisfied and which withholds one forever
from a contented mind.</p>

<p>Finally, of all people who seek for happiness,
the most unhappy are those who seek
it in mere conformity to religious creeds.
There are many such people in our day,
and they find themselves in the end bitterly
disappointed. For all church organizations
are inclined to promise more than they can
assure, and are like nets to catch all manner
of fish. In a passage from the works of the late
Professor Gelzer, he remarks that, for most
church-going people, worship is nothing
more than “appearing at Court once a week
to present one’s respects to the throne.” He
adds that there is the same formal service
of man also; for one sometimes does this
service, or, as the Bible says, “Hath wrought
a good work upon me,” only for the better
maintenance in the future of one’s own self-esteem.</p>

<p>I shall not contradict what so distinguished
a man out of his rich experience has
said on this subject. Yet, for my own part,
I must still believe that if a human soul
worships God even in the most irrational
way, and recognizes its dependence on Him,
God will not forsake that soul. I must believe,
still further, that the feeblest and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
superstitious expressions of religion bring to
one who, even with occasional sincerity, persists
in them, more happiness than the most
brilliant philosophy of atheism can offer. Yet
this blessing bestowed upon simple souls by
the patience of God is not to be attained in
its fulness by those who are capable of larger
insight. Such persons have the duty laid on
them to free the Christian Religion from the
lukewarmness which for two thousand years
has afflicted it. Theirs is the duty of dissatisfaction
with the forms and formulas of the
Church. No mere science of religion should
content them; for such a science alone never
brought happiness to man, and still offers to
a people who do not really understand its
teachings, stones instead of bread. So long
as people seek contentment in these ways,
their path to happiness must abound in disappointments;
and these disappointments
become the harder to bear because people,
as a rule, do not dare to confess either to
themselves, or to others, that they are thus
disappointed. They must pretend to themselves
that they are satisfied because they see
no path which may lead them back to happiness
and peace.</p>

<p>Such, then, are some of the ways by which,
with slight modifications and combinations,
the human race through all its history has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
sought for happiness; and if we do not recognize
these ways in history, we may find them
all with more or less distinctness in our own
experience. And yet by no one of these ways
has the race found the happiness it seeks.
What, then, I ask once more, is the path to
this end?</p>

<p>The first and the most essential condition
of true happiness, I answer, is a firm faith in
the moral order of the world. If one lack
this, if it be held that the world is governed
by chance or by those changeless laws of nature
which in their dealings with the weak
are merciless, or if, finally, one imagine the
world controlled by the cunning and power
of man,—then there is no hope of personal
happiness. In such an order of the world,
there is nothing left for the individual but to
rule, or to be ruled; to be either the anvil or
the hammer; and it is hard to say which of
the two would be to an honorable man the
more unworthy lot.</p>

<p>In national life especially, this view of
the world leads to constant war and preparation
for war, and the text-book of politics
becomes The Prince of Machiavelli.
From such a condition of war the only possible,
though partial, deliverance would be
through some vast governmental control,
ruling with iron force and comprehending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
in itself all civilized peoples. Such a State
would, at least, make war between States impossible,
as it was impossible in the Roman
Empire of the Cæsars, and as Napoleon I.
dreamed that it might be impossible in Europe.
Every right-minded man must inwardly
protest against a view which thus
robs man in his person of his will and in
his politics of his freedom; and history also
teaches, in many incidents, the emptiness
and folly of such a view. There are some persons
who believe that they are forced to accept
this social creed, because the conception
of the world as a moral order does not seem
to them sufficiently proved. To such persons,
I can only repeat that which is written
above the entrance to Dante’s hell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Through me the way is to the city dolent;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Through me the way is to eternal dole;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Through me the way among the people lost.</i></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="verse"><i>All hope abandon, ye who enter in!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>I go on to say, however, that formal proof
of this moral order of the world is impossible.
The ancient Hebrews believed that
one could not look upon the face of God
and live, and Christianity, in its turn, offers
us no formal proof of the character of God.
The only path that leads to the proof of
God is that which is followed in the Sermon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
on the Mount: “Blessed are the pure in
heart: for they shall see God.” Here is a
proof which any one may test whose heart
is pure; while from those who merely reason
about God’s order of the world He hides
Himself, and no man may rend by force the
veil that covers Him.</p>

<p>If, then, one begins simply to live as in
a moral world, his path to happiness lies
plainly before him. The door is open and no
man can shut it. Within his heart there is a
certain stability, rest, and assurance, which
endure and even gather strength amid all
outward storms. His heart becomes, as the
Psalmist says, not froward or fearful, but
“fixed.” The only peril from which he now
has to guard himself is the peril of regarding
too seriously the changeful impressions and
events of each day. His desire must be to
live resolutely in one even mood, and to look
for his daily share of conscious happiness not
in his emotions, but in his activity. Then for
the first time he learns what work really is. It
is no more to him a fetish, to be served with
anxious fear; it is no longer an idol through
which he worships himself; it is simply the
natural and healthy way of life, which frees
him not only from the many spiritual evils
which are produced by idleness, but also
from numberless physical evils which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the same source. Happy work is the healthiest
of human conditions. Honest sweat on
the brow is the source of permanent and
self-renewing power and of light-heartedness;
and these together make one really
happy. Indeed, the later discoveries of medical
science are teaching us that physical
health is secured only by a high degree of
power of resistance against enemies which
life cannot avoid. But this power of resistance—as
one may soon discover—is not a
merely physical capacity; it is quite as much
a moral quality and in large part the product
of moral effort. Here, then, are two secrets
of happiness which are fundamentally inseparable:
Life directed by faith in the permanent
moral order of the world, and Work
done in that same faith. Beyond these two,
and one other which I shall mention later,
all other ways of happiness are secondary,
and indeed all else comes of its own accord,
according to one’s special needs, if only one
holds firmly to these primary sources of
spiritual power.</p>

<p>I go on to mention a few of these subordinate
rules for happiness which may be
deduced from the experience of life. They
are mere maxims of conduct to which many
others might be added.</p>

<p>We need, for instance, to be at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
time both brave and humble. That is the
meaning of the strange word of the Apostle:
“When I am weak, then am I strong.” Either
quality alone does more harm than good.</p>

<p>Again, one must not make pleasure an
end, for pleasure comes of its own accord in
the right way of life, and the simplest, the
cheapest, and the most inevitable pleasures
are the best.</p>

<p>Again, one can bear all troubles, except
two: worry and sin.</p>

<p>Further, all that is really excellent has a
small beginning. The good does not show
its best at once.</p>

<p>Finally, all paths which it is best to follow,
are entered by open doors.</p>

<p>There are, it must be added, some difficulties
and problems which thoughtful people
should take into account in their intercourse
with others. One must not hate other
people, or, on the other hand, idolize them,
or take their opinions, demands, and judgments
too seriously. One must not sit in
judgment on others, or, on the other hand,
submit himself to their judgment. One must
not court the society of those who think
much of themselves. Indeed, I may say in
general that, except in certain callings, one
should not cultivate acquaintance with great
people, or fine people, with the rich, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
fashionable, but so far as possible, without
repelling them, should avoid their company.
Among the best sources of happiness is the
enjoyment found in small things and among
humble people; and many a bitter experience
is avoided by the habit of an unassuming
life. The best way to have permanent
peace with the world is not to expect much
of it; not to be afraid of it; so far as one can
without self-deception see the good in it;
and to regard the evil as something powerless
and temporary which will soon defeat
itself.</p>

<p>In short, I may in conclusion say, that
one must not take this life too seriously.
As soon as we live above it, much of it becomes
unimportant, and if the essentials are
secure we must not care too much for the
subordinate. Many of the best people suffer
from this magnifying of trifles, and especially
from their dependence on other people’s
opinions; and this lack of proportion
makes for such people each day’s work much
more difficult than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>I have said that these practical rules might
be indefinitely multiplied. But they are all,
as I have also said, in reality superfluous.
For if the soil of the heart is fertilized, as I
have already described, then these fruits of
life grow out of it spontaneously, and serve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the special needs of the individual. The essential
question concerns the soil itself, without
which not one of these practical fruits
can grow. Thus I may say in general that
I take no great interest in what people call
systems of morals, or in the rules of conduct
which they prescribe. A system of morals
either issues spontaneously from a habit of
mind, which in its turn issues from a view
of life, attained even through the death of
one’s old self; or else such a system is nothing
but a series of beautiful maxims, pleasant
to hear, good to record in diaries and
calendars, but incapable of converting the
human heart.</p>

<p>I do not care to multiply the material for
these collections of maxims. I shall only add
one last and solemn truth. It is this,—that
under the conditions of human life unhappiness
also is necessary. Indeed, if one cared
to state it in a paradox, he might say that
unhappiness is essential to happiness. In the
first place, as the experience of life plainly
shows, unhappiness is inevitable, and one
must in one way or another reconcile himself
to it. The most to which one can attain
in this human lot is perfect adjustment
to one’s destiny; that inward and permanent
peace which, as Isaiah says, is like an “overflowing
stream.” It is this peace and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
alone which Christ promises to his disciples,
and it is this, and no outward satisfaction,
which the Apostle Paul expects for his fellow-Christians,
when, at the end of his unpeaceful
life, he prays that “the peace of
Christ may rule” in their hearts.</p>

<p>Thus, for real happiness the outward issue
of events may come to have no high importance.
Stoicism endeavored to solve the
problem of happiness by developing insensibility
to pain, but its endeavor was vain.
The problem of happiness is to be solved
in quite another way. One must accept his
suffering and unhappiness, and adjust himself
to them. And to this end one is, first of
all, helped by considering what unhappiness
implies, and by living consistently above the
sway of momentary feeling. For unhappiness
does us good in no less than three ways,—ways
which are cumulative in their effect.
It is, in the first place, a punishment, the
natural consequence of our deeds. It is, thus
considered, a part of those deeds themselves,
and therefore must follow them as surely as
a logical consequence follows its premise.
Unhappiness is, secondly, a cleansing process,
waking us to greater seriousness and
greater receptivity to truth. Thirdly, unhappiness
recalls us to self-examination and
fortifies us by disclosing what is our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
strength, and what is God’s strength. By no
other experience does one attain that spiritual
courage which is far removed from self-confidence
and very near to humility. In a
word, it must be said that the deeper life of
man and that noble bearing which we remark
in some people, and which no one, whatever
be his station, can falsely assume, are attained
only through faithful endurance of misfortune.
That word of the Apostle Paul, “We
glory in tribulations,” is, like many of his
sayings, absolutely unintelligible to any one
who has not experienced what renewal of
power and what profound happiness may
be discovered through misfortune itself. It
is a form of happiness which one never forgets
if he has once really experienced it.</p>

<p>This, then, is the riddle of life which perplexes
many a man and turns him from the
right way,—that good people do not get the
good things which might seem to them their
due.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Suffering, then, lies on the road to life, and
one must expect to meet it if he would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
happy. Many a person, when he sees this lion
in his path, turns about and contents himself
with something less than happiness. And
yet it is also true, as experience teaches, that
in our misfortunes, as in our enjoyments, imagination
greatly outruns reality. Our pain
is seldom as great as our imagination pictures
it. Sorrow is often the gate which opens
into great happiness. Thus the true life calls
for a certain severity of dealing, as if one
should say to himself: “You may like to do
this thing, or you may not like to do it, but
you must do it”; and true education rests
on these two foundation stones,—love of
truth and courage for the right. Without
them, education is worthless. It is like the
kingdom of God which is to be taken by violence,
“And the violent take it with force.”
And thus, of all the human qualities which
lead to happiness, certainly the most essential
is courage.</p>

<p>We look back, then, finally, over what has
been said, and repeat what a gifted authoress
of our time, Gisela Grimm, has said in her
drama of Old Scotland: “Happiness is communion
with God, and the central spiritual
quality which attains this communion is courage.”
Other happiness than this is not to be
found on earth, and if there were happiness
without these traits, it would not be the happiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
we should desire. And this kind of
happiness is real. It is not, like every other
dream of happiness, an illusion from which
sooner or later one must wake. It does not
issue from our achievements or our compulsions.
On the contrary, when we have once
accepted and made our own the view of life
which I have described, and have ceased to
look about us for some other view, then happiness
comes to us by the way. It is a stream
of inward peace; broadening as we grow older,
first enriching our own souls and then pouring
itself forth to bless other lives.</p>

<p>This is the goal to which our life must
attain, if it hope for happiness, and to this
goal it can attain. Indeed, if once the first
decision be made, and the first steps taken,
then, as Dante says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">... “<i>This mount is such, that ever</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>At the beginning down below ’tis tiresome,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That going up shall be to thee as easy</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>As going down the current in a boat,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Then at this pathway’s ending thou wilt be.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Below at the foot of the mountain the fixed
decision is demanded. There one must absolutely
determine to pay any price which
shall be asked for the happiness which is real.
No further step can be taken without this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
first resolution, and by no easier path has
any one attained the happiness he sought.
Goethe, the teacher of those who sought
happiness in other ways, admitted—as I
have said—that in seventy-five years of life
he had had four weeks of content, and no
one who has followed him can, at the end of
life, when asked what his conscience testifies,
make better reply. We, on the other hand,
should be able, at the last, to say: “The days
of our years are threescore years and ten,
and though we be so strong as to come to
fourscore years, and though there has been
much labor and sorrow, still it has been a life
of happiness.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII. THE MEANING OF LIFE</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_t.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is the question of questions.
A man must be wholly
superficial or wholly animal
who does not at some time in
his life ask what is the meaning
of his life. Yet, sad to
say, most men end their lives
without finding an answer. Some repeat, in
their darker moods, the melancholy confession
of a mediæval philosopher: “I live, but
know not how long; I die, but know not
when; I depart, but know not whither. How
is it possible for me to fancy myself happy!”
Others drive from their minds these morbid
reflections which, as they say, “lead to nothing,”
and repeat: “Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die.”</p>

<p>Even among what we call cultivated people,
where education has made a profounder
view accessible, the number of those who
find the meaning of life is by no means large.
After some vain and superficial attempts to
save themselves they yield at last, and often
far too soon, to the pitiful programme of
self-indulgence. And what is their next step?
It is to pursue consistently this programme.
But there is not long left the health which is
necessary for this life of eating and drinking,
and then in throngs they make their pilgrimages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the women at the front, to Pastor
Kneipp, or Dr. Metzger, or some other infallible
healer, hoping for a quick restoration
and a second chance to waste their lives.</p>

<p>Still others there are who have not the
means to adopt this plan of life. Many of
these seek a substitute for it in some form
of social scrambling; or if this fails, commit
themselves to the new doctrine of economics,
according to which the only real
problem of life is the “stomach problem,”
and which teaches that in satisfying the
stomach the social ideals of the race will be
also satisfied.</p>

<p>Still others there are who are more subtle
and more critical. They have come to see
how impracticable are all these schemes to
redeem life from its troubles. Thus, after
they have tried many half-way measures,
they come at last to the confession of the
wisest of kings: “Vanity of vanities, all is
vanity.” They commit themselves to scepticism
concerning any meaning in life and to
the worship of non-existence. To them the
end of life is to be Nirvana, annihilation,
the forgetfulness of that which life has been;
and they fancy that they have attained a
very noble attitude toward life when, after
many years of sharp contention with their
healthy human nature, which steadily protests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
against these subtle negations, they are
able at last to repeat the words of the Hindoo
sage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“<i>Through birth and rebirth’s endless round</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>I ran and sought, but never found</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Who framed and built this house of clay.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>What misery!—birth for ay and ay!</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>O builder! thee at last I see!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Ne’er shalt thou build again for me.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Thy rafters all are broken now,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Demolished lies thy ridgepole, low.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>My heart, demolished too, I ween,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>An end of all desire hath seen.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such is the final word of their philosophy.
Neither light nor hope is left for human life.
He does the best who earliest recognizes the
hopelessness of life and hastens to its end.</p>

<p>Human nature, however, is so abounding
in life and so eager for life that except
in those transitory and morbid conditions
which we have come to describe as <i>fin de
siècle</i> moods, it is never long content to interpret
experience in terms of universal bankruptcy.
On the contrary, it insists that the
problem of philosophy must be in the future,
as it has been in the past, the shedding
of light on the meaning of life. It is a problem
which philosophy has often answered
with mere phrases, which have brought no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
meaning or comfort to the troubled heart
of man, and it is not surprising that since
the climax of this hollow formalism was
reached in Hegel, there has been a natural
distrust of philosophy.</p>

<p>And what is it in this speculative philosophy
which creates this distrust? It is its
attempt to regard the universe as self-explanatory.
Here, even at the present time,
is one of the fundamental propositions of
most philosophizing, against which no argument
may be permitted. It seems an essential
assumption of philosophy; since if other
ways of explanation of the universe were
superadded, philosophy as an independent
science would seem to be superfluous. Is
it certain, however, that the subordination
of philosophy thus apprehended would be,
after all, a great misfortune? What the human
mind is concerned about is not the perpetuation
of philosophy as a science, but the
discovery of some meaning in life itself, its
destiny, its past and its future; and one is
quite justified in losing interest in any science
which does not in the end contribute
to the interpretation and amelioration of human
life. We have a right to demand of philosophy
that she contribute to this end, and
that she shall speak also with some degree
of simplicity of language, dismissing the attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
to satisfy with empty and unintelligible
phrases the hunger of the soul for fundamental
truth.</p>

<p>And yet, from the time of Plato to that of
Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, the
making of phrases has been the special business
of philosophy. It has created a language
of its own, which separates it as by an impenetrable
hedge from the region of men’s
common talk; and when one translates such
language into the familiar speech of his own
time, where words have a definite meaning,
it is as though he withdrew from a veiled
goddess the disguise which gave her all her
power and dignity. The fact is that abstract
philosophy has never explained to any satisfaction
either the existence or the development
of the world; still less has philosophy
brought into unity these two conceptions,
and interpreted them through a single cause.
On the contrary, the history of philosophy
has been a history of words, conveying no
real interpretation, and it would seem as if in
the thousands of years of philosophic speculation
either some interpretation should
have been attained or that there should at
last be heard the confession that philosophy
can throw no further light on these fundamental
facts. Here, it would seem, we should
reach the end of philosophy, and should assume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
that the first cause of things is unknowable.</p>

<p>Philosophy, however, has seldom consented
to this confession of impotence. On
the contrary, it has repeatedly reverted to
some absolute assumption of an adequate
cause which lies behind the possibility of
proof. Sometimes it is the assumption of
a vital Substance, one and unchangeable;
sometimes it is the assumption of an infinite
concourse of atoms. Yet such conceptions
are in the highest degree elusive, and force
us to inquire whence such substance, be it
simple or infinitely divided, comes, how it
becomes quickened with life, and how it imparts
the life it has. The transition from such
mere movements of atoms to phenomena
of feeling or thought or will, makes a leap
in nature which no man has in the remotest
degree proposed to explain. On the contrary,
instead of bridging such a chasm the
most famous inquirers simply record the
melancholy confession: “Ignoramus, ignorabimus.”</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, philosophy has taught,
with many and large words, that the meaning
of the world resides in an opposition between
Being and Not-being. This is no new
doctrine and it is at least intelligent and intelligible.
Yet what we really need to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
concerns Being alone. It is the world that
lies before our eyes that interests us. How
has this world come to be, we ask, or is it
perhaps a mere illusion, the mirage of our
own thought, with no reality but that which
our own minds assign, as people in their despair
have sometimes believed it to be? As
for Non-existence, what rational interest has
this for us? Is it even an intelligible conception?
Does it not rather set before us a contradiction
which we may conceive, but can
never verify, and which has for life itself no
significance at all?</p>

<p>Still other philosophers invite us to turn
from the outward world whose final cause
thus eludes us, and to consider our own self-conscious
nature, the Ego, concerning which
no one can doubt and which no philosophy
is needed to prove. Yet no sooner does this
poor Ego issue from its own self-consciousness
and, as it were, take a step into the outward
world, as though to interpret through
itself the meaning of life, than it becomes
aware that some further and external cause
is necessary to explain even the Ego to itself.</p>

<p>Finally, philosophy, in its search for the
meaning of life, bows to the authority of natural
science and proposes to interpret experience
through some doctrine of development,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
or evolution, or heredity, or natural selection.
All that exists, it announces, comes of
some primitive protoplasm, or even of some
single primitive cell. Yet still there presses
the ancient question how such cells may have
been made and how there has been imparted
to them their infinite capacity for life and
growth. It is the question which the keen
and practical Napoleon asked as he stood a
century ago under the mystery of the stars
in Egypt. Turning to the scholar Monge, he
said: “Qui a fait tout cela?” To such a question
neither abstract philosophy nor natural
science has as yet given and, so far as we can
judge, will ever give any answer.</p>

<p>To interpret the world, then, by itself or
through itself is impossible, for there is in
the world itself no final cause. If the mind
of man is the final interpreter of the world,
then it becomes itself the God it seeks, and
the philosophers become the object of a kind
of worship. Here, indeed, is the outcome of
much philosophy to-day. If, however, the
philosophers have any power of observation,
they soon discover one positive barrier to
this excessive self-importance. It is the humbling
consciousness of limitation in their own
powers and in their own hold on life itself;
the inevitable impression, which no human
praise can remove, of their own defects; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
impossibility of finding a meaning even for
their own lives within those lives themselves.</p>

<p>Here is the weakness of that pantheism
which, from the time of Spinoza, has so
largely controlled speculative thought, and,
from the time of Hegel, Schopenhauer, and
Goethe, has been the prevailing creed of
cultivated people, so far as they concern
themselves with philosophy. No form of
philosophy is so demoralizing in its ethical
consequences as this. It breeds contempt of
moral activity; it forfeits the right of the will
to oppose what is evil and to create what is
good. Sooner or later the corollary of such a
faith appears in some form of superstition,
crude but compelling,—like hypnotism or
spiritualism, or the vulgar and noisy substitutes
for religion which are now so conspicuous.
Thus the cycle of philosophical speculation
fulfils itself, and returns after centuries
to the same point at which it began. The
final form of truth may come to be, not the
systems of abstract philosophy or of speculative
theology, which have proved so misleading
and unsatisfying, but simply a summing-up
of the experience of mankind, as
it has affected human destiny through the
history of the world; and in this experience
we have a philosophy better than abstractions,
and always within one’s reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>And where do we find this philosophy
which discovers the meaning of life not
through speculative reasoning but through
the interpretation of experience, and which
observes in experience a spiritual power
creating and maintaining both the world
and the individual? This is the view of life
which had its origin in Israel and was fulfilled
in Christianity. It cannot indeed be
called in the technical sense a philosophy,
for philosophy would feel itself called upon
to explain still further that Cause which it
thus reached. Theology as a positive science
meets the same fate as philosophy. It cannot
prove its God, as philosophy cannot interpret
the world or human life in or through
themselves. What people call ontology, or
the proofs of the being of God, is no real
science, and convinces none but him who is
already pledged. It is in the nature of God
to be beyond our interpretations. A god
who could be explained would not be God,
and a man who could explain God would
not be man. The legitimate aim of life is not
to see God as He is, but to see the affairs of
this world and of human life somewhat as
God might see them. It is, therefore, no new
thing to question whether theology can be
fairly called a science at all. On this point,
for instance, the evidence of Christ is in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
negative, and the theological speculations
of Christians are, in fact, not derived from
him. They proceed, on the contrary, from
the Apostle Paul, who applied to the proving
of Christianity the subtlety of theological
training which he had received under
Judaism; and even in his case it must be
remembered that his teaching was directed
to convince those who had been, like him,
trained in the theology of Israel.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined, therefore, that
the final Cause of the world which we call
God, can be philosophically proved. Faith
in God is first of all a personal experience.
Nothing should disguise this proposition,
though it is the stone of offence where many
stumble who are seeking an adequate meaning
of life. Nothing can be done to help
those who refuse this experience. No argument
can convince them. There is no philosophical
refutation of a determined atheism.</p>

<p>Here is an admission which must gravely
affect not only our religious and philosophical
relations with others, but even our practical
and political life. Here is the fundamental
difference between people of the same
nation, or condition, or time, or even family.
In other differences of opinion there may
be found some common ground, but between
faith and denial there is no common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
ground, because we are dealing with a question
of the will and because the human will
is free. The saying of Tertullian, that the human
soul is naturally Christian, is in a literal
sense quite untrue. Every man who reflects
on his responsibilities recognizes that he is
not naturally Christian. He is, at the most,
only possibly Christian, as Tertullian perhaps
meant to say. He is capable of becoming
Christian through the experience of life.
Atheism and Christianity are equally accessible
to the nature of man.</p>

<p>Faith in God, then, is a form of experience,
not a form of proof. If experience were as unfruitful
as proof, then faith in God would be
nothing more than a nervous condition, and
the answer of Festus—“Paul, thou art beside
thyself!”—would be the just estimate
of a faith like that of Paul. Each period
of history has in fact produced many a Festus,
sedulously guarding his reason and conscience
against all that cannot be proved.
Other faith, however, than that which proceeds
from experience is not expected by God
from any man; while to every man, in his
own experience and in the witness of history,
this faith is abundantly offered. There is,
therefore, in the refusal of faith a confession,
not merely of intellectual error, but of moral
neglect; and many a man who has surrendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
his faith would be slow to confess to
others how well aware he is that the fault is
his own.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the first step toward the
discovery of the meaning of life. It is an act
of will, a moral venture, a listening to experience.
No man can omit this initial step, and
no man can teach another the lesson which
lies in his own experience. The prophets of
the Old Testament found an accurate expression
for this act of will when they described
it as a “turning,” and they went on to assure
their people of the perfect inward peace and
the sense of confidence which followed from
this act. “Look unto me, and be ye saved,”
says Isaiah; “Incline your ear, and come unto
me: hear, and your soul shall live.” From
that time to this, thousands of those who
have thus changed the direction of their wills
have entered into the same sense of peace;
while no man who has thus given his will to
God has ever felt himself permanently bewildered
or forsaken.</p>

<p>Here, also, in this free act of the will, is
attained that sense of liberty which in both
the Old and New Testaments is described
as “righteousness.” It is a sense of initiative
and power, as though one were not wholly
the subject of arbitrary grace, but had a certain
positive companionship with God. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
what the Old Testament calls a “covenant,”
involving mutual rights and obligations. No
man, however, who accepts this relation is
inclined to urge overmuch his own rights,
knowing as he well does that his part in the
covenant falls ever short and is even then
made possible only through his steady confidence
in God. Grace, unearned and undeserved,
he still knows that he needs; yet
behind this grace lies ever the initiative of
personal “turning,” and the free assertion of
the will as the first step toward complete
redemption. To say with Paul that a man is
“justified by faith,” or to emphasize as Luther
does, even more strongly, the province
of grace, is to run some risk of forgetting
the constant demand for an initial step of
one’s own.</p>

<p>This step once taken, both the world in
which one lives and one’s own personal life
get a clear and intelligible meaning. On the
one hand stands the free will of God, creating
and directing the world, not restricted by the
so-called laws of nature, yet a God of order,
whose desires are not arbitrary or lawless.
On the other hand is the free will of man,
with the free choice before it of obedience
or refusal;—a will, therefore, which may
choose the wrong though it may not thereby
thwart the Divine purpose. The evil-doer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
if impenitent, must suffer, but his evil is converted
into good. In such a philosophy what
is a wisely adjusted human life? It is a life of
free obedience to the eternal and unchangeable
laws of God; a life, therefore, which attains
through self-discipline successive steps
of spiritual power. Life on other terms brings
on a progressive decline of spiritual power
and with this a sense of self-condemnation.
What is the happy life? It is a life of conscious
harmony with this Divine order of the world,
a sense, that is to say, of God’s companionship.
And wherein is the profoundest unhappiness?
It is in the sense of remoteness
from God, issuing into incurable restlessness
of heart, and finally into incapacity to make
one’s life fruitful or effective.</p>

<p>If, then, we are at times tempted to fancy
that all this undemonstrable experience is
unreal, or metaphysical, or purposeless, or
imaginary, it is best to deal with such returning
scepticism much as we deal with the
selfish or mean thoughts which we are trying
to outgrow. Let all these hindrances to the
higher life be quietly but firmly repelled. The
better world we enter is indeed entered by
faith and not by sight; but this faith grows
more confident and more supporting, until
it is like an inward faculty of sight itself. To
substitute for this a world of the outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
senses is to find no meaning in life which can
convey confidence and peace. It is but to embitter
every noble and thoughtful nature with
restless doubts from which there is no escape.</p>

<p>Such was religion as it disclosed itself to
the early Hebrews. Soon, indeed, that religion
was overgrown by the formalism which
converted its practical teaching into mere
prohibitions or mere mechanism; but behind
these abuses of later history lay the primitive
simplicity of spiritual liberty and life. Such
also was the historical beginning of the Christian
religion. The mission of Christ, like that
of each genuine reformer, was to recall men
to their original consciousness of God; and
it is perhaps the greatest tragedy of history,
while at the same time the best proof of the
free will of man, that the Hebrew people,
to whom Christ announced that he was expressly
sent, could not, as a whole, bring
themselves to obey his call. They were held
in bondage by their accumulated formalism,
as many a man has been ever since. They
could not rise to the thought of a worship
which was in spirit and in truth. Had they,
with their extraordinary gifts, been able to
hear Christ’s message, they would have become
the dominant nation of the world.</p>

<p>And what is to be said of those Gentile
peoples who listened more willingly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
message of Christ, those “wild olive trees,”
as St. Paul calls them, which were grafted
on the “broken branches”? They also have
had the same history. They also, in their
own way, have become enslaved by the same
formalism; and they also must regain their
liberty through the return of individual souls
to a personal experience of the method of
Christ.</p>

<p>Here is the evidence of the indestructible
truth and the extraordinary vitality of the
Christian religion. To subdue its opponents
was but a slight achievement; for every positive
truth must in the end prevail. Its real
conflict has been with the forces of accumulated
opinion, of superfluous learning, of
sickly fancies among its friends, and with the
intellectual slavery to which these influences
have led. Through these obstructions the
light and power of genuine Christianity have
broken like sunshine through a mist; and
with such Christianity have appeared in history
the political liberty on which the permanence
of civilization rests, the philosophical
truth which solves the problems of human
life, and the present comfort for the human
heart, beyond the power of misfortune to
disturb.</p>

<p>We reach, then, a philosophy of life which
is not speculative or fanciful, but rests on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the facts of history. This is “the way, the
truth, and the life.” Better is it for one if he
finds this “way” without too many companions
or professional guides, for many a religious
teaching, designed to show the way,
has repelled young lives from following it.
As one follows the way, he gains, first of all,
courage, so that he dares to go on in his
search. He goes still further, and the way
opens into the assurance that life, with all
its mystery, is not lived in vain. He pushes
on, and the way issues into health, not only
of the soul but even of the body; for bodily
health is more dependent on spiritual condition
than spiritual condition on bodily
health; and modern medicine can never restore
and assure health to the body if it limit
its problem to physical relief alone. Nor is
even this the end of the “way” of Christ. It
leads not only to personal health, but to social
health as well; not by continually inciting
the masses to some social programme, but
by strengthening the individuals of which
the masses are made. Here alone is positive
social redemption; while the hopes that turn
to other ways of social reform are for the most
part deceptive dreams.</p>

<p>Finally, the way is sure to lead every life
which follows it, and is willing to pay the
price for the possession of truth, into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
region of spiritual peace. No other way of
life permits this comprehensive sense of
peace and assurance. Apart from it we have
but the unremitting and bitter struggle for
existence, the enforcement of national self-seeking,
the temporary victory of the strong,
the hell of the weak and the poor; yet, at
the same time, no peace even for the strong,
who have their little day of power, but live
in daily fear that this power will fail and
leave them at the mercy of the wolves, their
neighbors. Meantime, on every page of the
world’s history, and in the experience of
daily life, God writes the opposite teaching,
that out of the midst of evil issues at last the
mastery of the good; and that, in modern as
in ancient time, the meek both inherit and
control the earth. History is not a record of
despotic control like that of a Roman Cæsar,
effective and intelligent, but necessarily involving
a progressive degeneration of his
subjects; it is a story of progressive amelioration
in moral standards and achievements;
and this fact of moral progress is the most
convincing proof of the being of God.</p>

<p>Thus it happens that to one who loves
liberty and who reads history, the logic of
thought leads to faith in God. Without such
faith it is difficult to believe in human progress
through freedom, or to view the movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
of the modern world with hope. Without
such faith the popular agitations of the
time are disquieting and alarming, and the
only refuge of the spirit is in submission to
some human authority either of Church or
of State. Without such faith it would be increasingly
impossible to maintain a democratic
republic like Switzerland in the midst
of the autocratic monarchies of Europe.
With profound truthfulness the Swiss Parliament
at Aarau opened its session with
these simple words: “Our help is in the
Lord our God, who hath made heaven and
earth.” And, finally, without political liberty
there would be but a brief survival of religious
liberty itself, and it too would be supplanted
by a condition of servitude. A State-Church
is a self-contradictory expression.
State and Church alike need self-government
for self-development. A free Church
and a free State are not only most representative
of Christianity, but are beyond doubt
the forms of Christian citizenship which are
to survive. Not compulsion, nor any form
of authority, will in the end dominate the
world, but freedom, in all its forms and its
effects. The end of social evolution is to be
the free obedience of men and nations to the
moral order of the world.</p>

<p>And yet, we must repeat, the secret of true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
progress is not to be found in an achievement
of philosophy, or a process of thought;
but in a historical process, a living experience.
To each man’s will is offered the choice of
this way which leads to personal recognition
of the truth and personal experience of happiness.
To each nation the same choice is presented.
No philosophy or religion has real
significance which does not lead this way. No
man can rightly call it mere misfortune, or
confess his unbelief with sentimental regret,
when he misses the way and forfeits his peace
of mind. His pessimism is not, as he fondly
thinks, a mark of distinction; it is, on the
contrary, as a rule, an evidence of moral defect
or weakness, and should stir in him a
positive moral scorn.</p>

<p>What is it, then, which makes one unable
to find the way of Jesus? It is, for the most
part, either unwillingness to make a serious
effort to find it, or disinclination to accept
the consequences of the choice. To take up
with some philosophical novelty, involving
no demand upon the will; to surrender oneself
to the pleasures of life; to attach oneself,
with superficial and unreflecting devotion, to
some form of Church or sect;—how much
easier is any one of these refuges of the mind
than serious meditation on the great problems
of life and the growth of a personal conviction!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
And yet, how unmistakable have
been the joy, and the strength to live and to
die, and the peace of mind and sense of right
adjustment to the Universe, which those
have found who have followed with patience
the way I have described! In the testimony
of such souls there is complete accord. Consciously
or unconsciously, every heart desires
the satisfactions which this way of life
can give, and without these satisfactions of
the spirit no other possessions or pleasures
can insure spiritual peace.</p>

<p>What infinite pains are taken by people
in the modern world for the sake of their
health of body or the welfare of their souls!
For health of body they go barefoot in the
daytime or sleep in wet sheets at night; for
the good of their souls they go on pilgrimages
and into retreats, or submit themselves
to other forms of spiritual exercise. They go
even farther in their pious credulity. There
is not a hardship or a folly, or a risk of body
or soul, or any form of martyrdom, which is
not accepted by thousands in the hope that
it will save their souls. And all the time the
simple way to the meaning of life lies straight
before their feet,—a way, however, let us
last of all remember, which it is not enough
to know, but which is given us to follow.
This is the truth which a scholar of the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
of Luther teaches, though he himself had
not fully attained the truth. Not, he writes,
by knowing the way but by going it, is the
meaning of life to be found. He put into
the mouth of Christ his lesson:</p>

<p><i>“Friedrich Max von Klinger,” says Professor Hilty,
“was born in 1752, at Frankfort. His family were
poor, and after he had with difficulty pursued his
studies at the University of Giessen, he became at first
a play-writer for a travelling company. He then served
during the Bavarian War of Succession in a corps of
volunteers. Later he became reader and travelling companion
to the Czarevitch Paul of Russia, afterwards
the Emperor. He was made Director of the corps of
cadets of the nobility, as well as of the Emperor’s pages,
and of the girls’ school for the nobility. Under Alexander I.
he was also made Curator of the University
of Dorpat. In all these relations of life, which were as
difficult as can be imagined, in his contact with actors,
crown-princes, Czars, noble pages and women of the
court, diplomats and professors—who, taken together,
are certainly not of the classes most easy to deal with—and
living at a court thoroughly degraded and beset
by self-seekers of the lowest kind as was the court
of Catherine II., von Klinger preserved his candid
character and moral courage and gained the high respect
of his contemporaries. In Goethe’s Wahrheit
und Dichtung, he mentions von Klinger as follows:
‘This maintenance of a sterling character is the more
creditable when it occurs in the midst of worldly and
business life and when a way of conduct which might
appear to many curt and abrupt, being judiciously followed,
accomplishes its ends. Such was his character.
Without subservience (which, indeed, has never been a
quality of the natives of Frankfort) he attained to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
most important positions, was able to maintain himself
there and to continue his services with the highest approval
and gratitude of his noble patrons. Through
all this, he never forgot either his old friends or the
paths which he had come.’ In the later years of his
life, Goethe renewed the study of von Klinger’s writings,
‘which recalled to me his unwearied activity and
his remarkable character.’”</i></p>

<p class="center">COMMENTS</p>

<p>I find “The Quest of Happiness” a very rich and beautiful
work. It is eminently a book for the home. Wherever it
is known it must make life sweeter and more wholesome.
<span class="smcap">Philip S. Moxom</span>, <i>Pastor of South Congregational Church,
Springfield, Mass.</i></p>

<p>It is a book full of help and sympathy, marked by a wide
acquaintance with literature and with life, and by a true insight
into those conditions which make for the truest and best
existence. <span class="smcap">S. P. Cadman</span>, <i>Pastor of Central Congregational
Church, Brooklyn</i>.</p>

<p>It is a consummate statement of the highest conception of
the nature of human life, and of the only methods by which
its meaning and possibilities can be attained. Dr. Hillis is not
only a great master of style, but a serene satisfaction with
God’s method of moral government breathes from every page
and makes the teacher trustworthy. <span class="smcap">Charles Frederic
Goss.</span></p>

<p>“The Quest of Happiness” is Dr. Hillis’s very best book.
It is strong, vivid, clear, and has a certain indefinable human
quality which will be sure to give it a large circulation and
make it a source of great helpfulness. I especially enjoyed the
“Forewords.” They would make an attractive volume in
themselves. <span class="smcap">Amory H. Bradford</span>, <i>Pastor of First Congregational
Church, Montclair, N. J.</i></p>
